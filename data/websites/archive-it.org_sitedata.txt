The Legislative Assembly officially created Great Salt Lake County on January 31, 1850. Over 11,000 residents lived in the County at that time. The first formal meeting of Salt Lake County government occurred on March 15, 1852, eighteen months after the Utah Territory was established by the United States Congress. Probate judges and county selectmen functioned in what was known as the County Court. The duties of the County Court included both judicial and executive powers for the administration of county government.\n \nWith statehood in 1896, a county commission was created. At this time, County government had a County Auditor, Assessor, Attorney, Clerk, Recorder, Sheriff, Surveyor, and Treasurer – the same independent offices that exist today. In 2000, a new Mayor/Council form of government was chosen by the voters to replace the County Commission.  Today, County government serves over 1 million residents.  \n</p>\n\n\n</span></div></div><div style=\"visibility:\" class=\"item\" id=\"featured-item-33\"><a class=\"item_link\" href=\"/organizations/996\"><div class=\"entity-logo\"><img alt=\"Hampshire College\" src=\"/image/featured-organizations/996/tn\" class=\"tn\"></div><div><span class=\"item_title\">Hampshire College</span></div></a><div class=\"description\"><span class=\"ellipsis_text\"><p class=\"seamTextPara\">\nEstablished in 1965, Hampshire College is a four-year liberal arts college of 1,400 students located in Amherst, Massachusetts.

The Whitney is dedicated to collecting, preserving, interpreting, and exhibiting American art, and its collection--arguably the finest holding of twentieth-century American art in the world--is the Museum's key resource. The Museum's signature exhibition, the Biennial, is the country's leading survey of the most recent developments in American art.\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"seamTextPara\">\nInnovation has been a hallmark of the Whitney since its beginnings. It was the first museum dedicated to the work of living American artists and the first New York museum to present a major exhibition of a video artist (Nam June Paik in 1982). Such figures as Jasper Johns, Cy Twombly, and Cindy Sherman were given their first museum retrospectives by the Whitney. The Museum has consistently purchased works within the year they were created, often well before the artists became broadly recognized. The Whitney was the first museum to take its exhibitions and programming beyond its walls by establishing corporate-funded branch facilities, and the first museum to undertake a program of collection-sharing (with the San Jose Museum of Art) in order to increase access to its renowned collection.\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"seamTextPara\">\nDesigned by architect Renzo Piano and situated between the High Line and the Hudson River, the Whitney's new building vastly increases the Museum’s exhibition and programming space, providing the first comprehensive view of its unsurpassed collection of modern and contemporary American art.</p>\n</span></div></div></div><div class=\"item-page hidden\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><div style=\"visibility:\" class=\"item\" id=\"featured-item-156\"><a class=\"item_link\" href=\"/organizations/629\"><div class=\"entity-logo\"><img alt=\"Connecticut College\" src=\"/image/featured-organizations/629/tn\" class=\"tn\"></div><div><span class=\"item_title\">Connecticut College</span></div></a><div class=\"description\"><span class=\"ellipsis_text\"><p class=\"seamTextPara\">\nThe Linda Lear Center for Special Collections and Archives preserves the institutional memory of Connecticut College from its founding in 1911 to the present-day.
