TV news station. &ldquo;I had an opportunity to start reporting at the station in Dayton, Ohio. One of my superiors, right when I started, said women didn&rsquo;t belong in sports,&rdquo; Faris said. &ldquo;And you won&rsquo;t make it unless you show&hellip; something that rhymes with bits, alright, so he said you won&rsquo;t make it unless you show your goods.&rdquo; WKEF/WRGT-TV, locally known as &ldquo;ABC 22/ FOX 45&rdquo; and owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group, is the Dayton station listed in Faris&rsquo; biography on ABC&rsquo;s website. Faris also is a 1997 Cedarville University graduate, according to the school&rsquo;s website. Faris did not name the individual who she said harassed her and she did not name the station. The View airs on ABC 22 in Dayton. The station&rsquo;s general manager could not be reached to comment. &ldquo;I kind of thought what doesn&rsquo;t kill you makes you stronger but on my way out, about a year later I got another job,&rdquo; Faris said. &ldquo;&hellip;So I just wrote a letter to the human resources department on my way out saying that this guy was abusing people verbally and I wasn&rsquo;t in it for litigation or money or anything, I don&rsquo;t know what happened.&rdquo; Faris&rsquo; comments were made as hosts of The View were discussing the sexual harassment scandal that led to Bill O&rsquo;Reilly being fired from Fox News earlier this week. The View showed a clip of former Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin saying that women who are sexually harassed should speak out. &ldquo;Sometimes it&rsquo;s really hard&rdquo; for victims of sexual harassment to speak up, Faris said, before telling the story of her own experience. Faris told the Dayton Daily News she did not want to share further details of the harassment incident. &ldquo;This was roughly 16 years ago. And, is really water under the bridge, as far as I&rsquo;m concerned,&rdquo; Faris said via email. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not interested in publicly naming someone and assassinating their character, further. I shared with the sole intent of hoping others, women and men, would be more courageous in sharing their own stories.&rdquo; Brian Butler, an attorney at Mezibov-Butler law firm in Cincinnati, said that under federal law, cases of sexual harassment have to be reported within 300 days for legal action to be taken. Ohio law allows for a case of sexual harassment to be reported within 6 years, Butler said.

Robert Sweeney&rsquo;s last day as part of the WSU administration will be May 20, said spokesman Seth Bauguess. Sweeney also serves as secretary to the board of trustees. Sweeney will return to a finance faculty position in the Raj Soin College of Business. He will begin teaching full-time again either this summer or in the fall, Bauguess said. Sweeney was not immediately available to comment on Thursday. Sweeney&rsquo;s resignation comes just days after this news organization learned that provost Tom Sudkamp and associate provost Steven Berberich are looking to leave the university. The two leaders were named as finalists for jobs at two different universities in Arkansas. Robert Fyffe, Wright State&rsquo;s vice president of research and graduate school dean, also recently announced he would resign, effective Sept. 30. Fyffe&rsquo;s resignation came less than two weeks after an audit of WSU&rsquo;s research funding was released by the board of trustees. The leadership changes come as the school is dealing with a financial crisis that requires the administration to cut $25 million from next year&rsquo;s budget to balance the books. Wright State trustees have said they expected administrators to resign as the university begins the transition of bringing its next president into office. -->\n<article class=\"story cm-channel-story cm-story cm-image\">\n\t    <a href=\"/news/wright-state-executive-vice-president-resigns/9B5hCAVi2fqBaNPOX4zXuM/\" class=\"story-photo-link\" target=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"/rf/image_inline/Pub/p8/DaytonDailyNews/2017/04/21/Images/newsEngin.18475816_Robert-J.-Sweeney.jpg\" title=\"Wright State’s executive vice president resigns \" alt=\"Wright State’s executive vice president resigns \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"story-tease-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"story-title\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/news/wright-state-executive-vice-president-resigns/9B5hCAVi2fqBaNPOX4zXuM/\" target=\"\">Wright State’s executive vice president resigns </a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t        <p class=\"story-byline\">\n    \n\t    by\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nMax Filby</p>\n<div class=\"story-text cm-truncate is-truncated\" style=\"word-wrap: break-word; visibility: visible;\"><div>Wright State University’s executive vice president of planning is resigning, the Dayton Daily News has learned.

Three out of four market vendors have committed to opening on Sundays during a 13-week pilot program that starts at the beginning of June, said Jimmy Harless, manager of the 2nd Street Market. Most of the market&rsquo;s major vendors will be open for business, and every type of seller will be represented on Sundays, including three outside farmer vendors, Harless said. Pavilion vendors, who sell crafts, art, jewelry and other creations, also will have a strong representation, and musicians will be present, playing for tips, Harless said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to offer pretty much everything we offer on Saturday,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll have more of a Saturday feel with the outside market, with music for entertainment.&rdquo; RELATED: 2nd Street Market to test expanded hours Some vendors who plan on being open on Sundays include Caffeine Carl, the Flowerman, KJB Farm, the Olive Tree, the Chef Case, Crepe Boh&egrave;me, Spice Rack & Bulk Foods, Cheeky Meat Pies, Tim&rsquo;s Gifts N More, New World Alpaca Textiles, Dayton Urban Green, Animal Snackers Bakery, Arepas & Co. Express and Azra&rsquo;s Mediterranean Cuisine. &ldquo;We are so excited and so ready for this,&rdquo; said Azra Kaurin, owner of Azra&rsquo;s Mediterranean Cuisine. Five Rivers MetroParks&rsquo; pilot program, if successful, could lead the market to not only bring back Sunday hours in 2018 but also possibly expand its hours of operation further, officials said. Success will be measured by attendance, feedback and vendor participation. For this year, pulling Friday attendance figures on a Sunday would be an achievement, said Amy Forsthoefel, Five Rivers MetroParks&rsquo; research and analysis manager. That equates to about 1,000 to 1,200 people every Sunday. It&rsquo;s unclear if the market will be able to reach that benchmark, but officials expect Sundays to feel a lot more like Saturdays than either Thursdays or Fridays. Saturdays draw about 5,000 visitors during the peak parts of summer. RELATED: Will Sunday hours at 2nd Street Market work? For years, the buzz around the market was that vendors would love the opportunity to open on Sundays. Now that they have that chance, vendors have lined up to participate in the pilot program, which runs June 4 to Aug. 27. Customers also have expressed lots of interest in Sunday hours. The market will soon learn if customers&rsquo; enthusiasm matches the vendors. -->\n<article class=\"story cm-channel-story cm-story cm-image\">\n\t    <a href=\"/news/dayton-2nd-street-market-vendors-will-open-test-sundays/1tZaQtaObhag7RWhaVimLK/\" class=\"story-photo-link\" target=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"/rf/image/Pub/p8/WHIO/2017/03/16/Videos/3954836.vpx\" title=\"Dayton’s 2nd Street Market: 3 in 4 vendors will open to test Sundays \" alt=\"Dayton’s 2nd Street Market: 3 in 4 vendors will open to test Sundays \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"story-tease-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"story-title\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/news/dayton-2nd-street-market-vendors-will-open-test-sundays/1tZaQtaObhag7RWhaVimLK/\" target=\"\">Dayton’s 2nd Street Market: 3 in 4 vendors will open to test Sundays </a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t        <p class=\"story-byline\">\n    \n\t    by\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nCory Frolik, <span class=\"story-source\">Staff Writer</span>\n\t</p>\n<div class=\"story-text cm-truncate is-truncated\" style=\"word-wrap: break-word; visibility: visible;\"><div>The calendar will say Sunday, but it will feel a lot like Saturday at the 2nd Street Market this summer when the market tests out expanded hours.

Commercial marijuana grow operations were found at two of the four murder scenes.&nbsp; But DeWine and Pike County Sheriff Charles Reader have since expressed the belief that the perpetrators &ndash; the consensus is that there&rsquo;s more than one &ndash; were local to Pike County. Some officials have speculated the suspects were even closer to the family. Leonard Manley, whose daughter Dana Rhoden, 37, was one of the eight victims, has previously said whoever entered the property had to be familiar to the family&rsquo;s dogs, or else they would have barked and attacked.&nbsp; The victims suffered a combined 32 gunshot wounds &ndash; one was shot nine times, two were shot five times each &ndash; and some showed soft tissue bruising, suggesting they may have been beaten, according to autopsy reports. DeWine and Reader would not say at a recent press conference if they believe they&rsquo;ve interviewed the perpetrator(s).&nbsp; DeWine and Reader gave a press conference April 13 and stressed that the case is still a top priority.&nbsp; But after more than 800 tips, 400 interviews, 38 search warrants and a dozen investigators constantly on the ground in Piketon, there have been no arrests.&nbsp; DeWine and Reader declined to discuss possible motives, a time-frame for the investigation or scenarios that have been ruled out.&nbsp; They insist a lack of disclosure about new details will protect the integrity of the investigation &mdash; the largest in the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation history. They also insist the case is not cold, and that there exists &mdash; somewhere in the county, or elsewhere &mdash; someone with answers. &ldquo;We will find you,&rdquo; Reader said to the killer or killers. &ldquo;We will arrest you, and you will be prosecuted.&rdquo; The sheriff&rsquo;s office has hung posters all in various locations around Piketon, advertising a $10,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest in the case.&nbsp; Crime Stoppers is accepting donations to increase that amount.&nbsp; But Reader admitted at the recent press conference that fear of reprisal is still a real factor in this case.&nbsp; He said he&rsquo;s sure some of the people they&rsquo;ve interviewed have lied to them, whether out of fear of getting in trouble for criminal activity, or out of fear that they could be next.&nbsp; The killings were committed&nbsp;&ldquo;execution-style,&rdquo; and whoever did it is still out there. In the immediate aftermath of the crimes, Reader told other members of the Rhoden family to arm themselves for protection.&nbsp; DeWine said solving the murders is the top priority, and detectives need information. &ldquo;This is a homicide investigation,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that we don&rsquo;t care what you&rsquo;ve done with drugs &ndash; we care, but our focus is on the homicide, and so people should not be concerned about coming forward and disclosing information that may be helpful in the investigation.&rdquo; Was the family killed by rival drug dealers or were the murders in connection to other criminal activity? There was evidence they were raising roosters for cock fighting, DeWine has said. This criminal activity, Reader said, was &ldquo;minute&rdquo; compared to their slaughter. &ldquo;Regardless of their lifestyle, they were human beings,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; Was the murder more personal? In the immediate aftermath, several individuals who had expressed prior disputes&nbsp;with Rhoden family members on social media were questioned, but quickly let go.&nbsp; There have been more rumors than concrete theories when it comes to motive.&nbsp; Things are quieter now in the rural community, but the specter of these slayings, unsolved, still hangs over the people of Pike County. A billboard with the victim&rsquo;s faces literally hovers over the sheriff&rsquo;s office.&nbsp; &ldquo;I see the look of disappointment when I speak with the family, and I look into their eyes and the grieving they still have,&rdquo; Reader said last week.

Tournament sponsor John Higgins reports that more than $100,000 has been raised in the last three years. All of it goes to the local chapter of the First Tee program that serves approximately 6,000 young people every summer. The event is limited to 24 teams who will use the Stableford scoring system with three of the players&rsquo; scores counting on each hole. The winning team qualifies for the national event at Pebble Beach. Potential entrants can register at Lexusofdayton.com or by contacting DCC golf pro Rob Karnes at 294-3352. Nicklaus at Madden? Would you believe Jack Nicklaus once played in a significant golf tournament at Dayton&rsquo;s Madden Golf Course. If not, you can start believing. Nicklaus played in the Ohio Open Championship at Madden in 1958 when he was 18. He had won the Ohio Open in 1956 at the age of 16, but the Dayton event was won by Bob Shave. Dayton was represented in the event by the late Jack Zimmerman, among others. The Ohio Open, now staged by the Northern Ohio PGA Section, includes professionals and amateurs and is not to be confused with the Ohio Amateur Championship. The Ohio Am has been held five times at Springfield Country Club, four times each at Miami Valley Golf Club and Moraine Country Club and three times at NCR. Springfield CC will host it for the sixth time July 11-14. Chip shots &bull; The American Junior Golf Association will hold a tournament at Sugar Valley Country Club for the third time when a 36-hole Preview Series event comes to the Bellbrook course next weekend. Last year&rsquo;s winners included Alyssa Burritt of Bellbrook and Zach Crawford of Vandalia. Burritt is a member of the University of Cincinnati women&rsquo;s golf team and Crawford is a senior at Vandalia-Butler who will attend Ohio State in the fall. &bull; In one day a couple of weeks ago 22 tree stumps were removed at Community Golf Course. The stumps had been between the parallel No. 1 and No. 18 holes on the Outside and Inside courses and between holes 9 and 10 and 12 and 18 on the Inside course. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a start,&rdquo; said Community green superintendent Bob Bajek. Over the last two or three years, many ash trees were cut down on the Community property because emerald ash borers were destroying them. &bull; Joe Bohardt advises that a reunion is being planned in August for men who caddied at Dayton Country Club between 1960 and 1975. If you fit that profile and would like to participate, send your contact information to: dccreunioncaddies@gmail.com. &bull; Entries are being accepted for the annual George Klockson Golf Tournament which will be held June 3 at Community Golf Course. The Klockson is a two-man, best ball event with half handicap. The entry fee is $140 per team, and the deadline is May 27. Last year there were 68 players, and the goal this year is to have 100.

Period. As much as they opposed the legislation, DataYard principals (and father and son) David and Alek Mezera, say they saw the government&rsquo;s move as a chance to distinguish their company. &ldquo;They (other companies) can collect it, they can store it for indefinite periods of time and they can do what they see fit with it, when they decide to do so,&rdquo; said Alek Mezera, the younger Mezera and the company&rsquo;s director of client partnerships. &ldquo;We will not collect it,&rdquo; said David Mezera, company president. &ldquo;We will not keep it for any longer than is necessary to deliver the services we deliver. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re absolutely not interested in monetizing that information.&rdquo; The federal privacy rules would have taken effect this year. Enshrined by the previous administration, they would have banned Internet providers from collecting, sharing and mostly importantly, selling user information without consent. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think was a surprise, really,&rdquo; the younger Mezera said of Congress&rsquo; push back against the rules. Ajit Pai &mdash; nominated by the Trump administration this year to be FCC chairman &mdash; has said the Federal Trade Commission, not the FCC, should regulate how Internet providers use data. Now in its 22nd year, DataYard was born as Donet, with all of eight phone lines in the beginning. It re-branded as DataYard in 2012. &ldquo;We were taking a more strategic business focus, instead of the residential consumer market that we initially started with in &lsquo;95&rdquo; DataYard&rsquo;s president said. The business since then has transformed. Today with 13 employees, the focus goes beyond Internet access. Offered also are server co-location, cloud computing, data backup and more. The Internet back in the mid-90s was basically a hobby, the Mezeras recalled. Today, it is threaded into our lives in ways few imagined back then. &ldquo;Now, the Internet is an essential utility,&rdquo; the older Mezera said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an essential element of every business.&rdquo; Based downtown at 130 W. Second St., the company is bigger today but remains local &mdash; and unmistakeably Daytonian. The focus is not necessarily on ever-growing sales, but on building relationships with customers. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not trying to get a national footprint or a global footprint,&rdquo; Dave said. Why not aim to get bigger? &ldquo;It&rsquo;s harder to maintain those personal relationships,&rdquo; the elder Mezera said. &ldquo;You lose that flavor.&rdquo; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a race to the bottom from the price side,&rdquo; Alek said. -->\n<article class=\"story cm-channel-story cm-story cm-image\">\n\t    <a href=\"/business/protecting-your-data/bSm7FNPHEv4UbzjBru4zbI/\" class=\"story-photo-link\" target=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"/rf/image_inline/Pub/p8/MyDaytonDailyNews/2017/04/29/Images/newsEngin.18406259_Alek,-Dave-Mezera.jpg\" title=\"Protecting your data \" alt=\"Protecting your data \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"story-tease-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"story-title\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/business/protecting-your-data/bSm7FNPHEv4UbzjBru4zbI/\" target=\"\">Protecting your data </a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t        <p class=\"story-byline\">\n    \n\t    by\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t  \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThomas Gnau</p>\n<div class=\"story-text cm-truncate is-truncated\" style=\"word-wrap: break-word; visibility: visible;\"><div>When President Donald Trump this month signed legislation that repealed Federal Communication Commission privacy protections for Internet users, the principals behind Dayton-based ‘Net services firm DataYard had a simple message: DataYard will not sell customer information.</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</article>\n\n\t\t            \n\t\t        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n<!-- Rendering article, 16, false -->\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n\t\t        \n\t\t            \n\t\t            \n\t\t                \n\t\t                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t                <!-- DEBUGGER: teasibleProperties.tag CUSTOM TEASE check -->\n        <!-- rootContainerSectionId: / -->\n        <!-- rootContainerPrimaryCategory: /Online/Home -->\n        <!-- object: PortalWebObjectWrapper [+      2679#] /Pub/p8/CmgSharedContent/2017/04/18/Stories/Record store day.xml [ConcreteProxyImpl:EOM::CompoundStory, 2.0.3042145761] -->\n        <!-- cacheScope: ContextMap[_rootContainerContextMap:ContextMap[primaryCategory:/Online/Home, sectionId:/]] -->\n        <!-- cacheScope type: class com.eidosmedia.portal.render.ctx.ContextMap -->\n        <!-- noRootContainer:  -->\n    \n \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n                        \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     \n\n\n        \n            \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n\n\t            \n\t               \n\t                \n\t                \n\t                \n\t                    \n\t                    \n\t                \n\t                    \n\t                    \n\t                \n\t                    \n\t                    \n\t                \n\t                    \n\t                    \n\t                \n\t                    \n\t                    \n\t                \n\t                    \n\t                    \n\t                \n\t                    \n\t                    \n\t                \n\t                \n\t                \n\t            \n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n\t\t    \n        \n        \n    \n<!-- map content:  The plop of the record drop, the scratch of the needle finding its groove - those are just some of the memories that come to mind when you talk about record albums. &gt;&gt; Read more trending news&nbsp; &nbsp;Record Store Day started as a grassroots celebration of vinyl albums by independent record store owners in 2007, with the first Record Store Day coming the next year, on April 19, 2008.

RELATED: Guns at work: New law allows handguns on private property Ohio legislators passed the bill in the December lame duck session and it was signed by Ohio Gov. John Kasich, taking effect March 21. RELATED: 5 things to know about Ohio&rsquo;s CCW law The bill was controversial. Business leaders opposed a government mandate requiring them to let employees bring their guns to work on to personal property even if the business has a no-guns policy. RELATED: Business groups lament Ohio expanded gun laws Gun safety advocates said it would make people less safe and criticized Ohio&rsquo;s continued push to expand the places where guns are allowed. The state has been broadening the concealed carry law since it was first passed in 2004. RELATED: do concealed-carry laws make us safer? &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t think the proliferation of guns everywhere is an answer,&rdquo; said Ohio House Minority Leader Fred Strahorn, D-Dayton. &ldquo;The straw that broke the camel&rsquo;s back is the personal property issue.&rdquo; But proponents of expanded concealed carry rights said the new law gives people the ability to exercise their Second Amendment rights and to protect themselves with handguns in more places. State Rep. Niraj Antani, R-Miamisburg, said he supported the expanded gun rights bill because it &ldquo;was a very pro-Second Amendment bill.&rdquo; &ldquo;The vast majority of CCW holders are good citizens and law-abiding,&rdquo; Antani said. RELATED: CCW Expansion is latest effort to broaden gun laws in Ohio All 50 states and the District of Columbia have some form of concealed-carry. About half allow people to bring their guns to the parking lot of their workplace. RELATED: Hundreds killed by guns in workplace Ohio&rsquo;s law covers only people who have concealed carry permits for handguns. They may bring the gun to their workplace parking lot as long as it is kept locked in their vehicle. A company many not discipline them for doing so.

It gives government officials - such as county commissioners or city councils - and the trustees of colleges and universities the ability to vote to allow concealed carry on their premises. Businesses were already permitted to allow guns on their property but the law expands that rule to child care centers, which had been prohibited from allowing people to bring in guns. There are limitations for federal facilities, such as Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and post offices, which can continue to ban guns from their property.

The city needs to maintain the 2.25 percent rate that generates about $600,000 annually due to state action that has led the city to losing about $1 million in revenue annually, according to city Finance Director Tom Reilly. RELATED: Council considers making income tax hike permanent Passage of Issue 13 on May 2 would fund general operating expenses, according to the Montgomery County Auditor&rsquo;s Office. But it would primarily benefit police and fire services, which receive about 65 percent of those funds, City Manager Brad Townsend said. The income tax revenue, which goes into the city&rsquo;s $7.6 million general fund, also pays for other items, such as parks and recreation expenses, he said. RELATED: City approves ballot issue to keep income tax at 2.25 percent &ldquo;So, if they&rsquo;re happy with their services, it&rsquo;s not a tax increase,&rdquo; Townsend said. &ldquo;It merely continues what they&rsquo;re already paying. We would hope that they support it.&rdquo; Cuts in the local government fund, the elimination of the estate tax, public utility tax reimbursements, and tangible personal property tax reimbursements have also cut revenue streams, according to the city. These cuts challenge municipalities - as they should - to be more accountable in using taxpayers&rsquo; money, said Greg Lawson, policy analyst for the Buckeye Institute of Public Policy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really important that local governments are able to justify what they&rsquo;re spending their money on,&rdquo; he said. While not in favor of higher income taxes, the Buckeye institute is &ldquo;actually comfortable with local taxpayers making that decision,&rdquo; Lawson said. &ldquo;If voters say we want to pay higher income taxes for whatever the service is, then that&rsquo;s a decision that local taxpayers can make,&rdquo; he said. RELATED: Cities near dispatch deal Other funding reductions came through state legislation, city officials said. The passage of Ohio House Bill 5 in 2015 &ndash; which involved changes in municipal tax collection - has already cost the city about $100,000. When fully implemented, it will reduce city revenue by about $400,000 annually, according to the city. HB 69 put guidelines on cities&rsquo; red-light cameras that did not make it cost effective to operate West Carrollton&rsquo;s program, Townsend has said, removing another $125,000 of revenue from the city. RELATED: Centerville, West Carrollton agree to shared dispatch plan The city is spending about $200,000 a year more than it is taking in &ldquo;just to get by&rdquo; and is operating at 2000 budget levels, Townsend said. West Carrollton Mayor Jeff Sanner has said he has &ldquo;no doubt&rdquo; the city will need to keep the tax hike in light of state cuts.

Meanwhile, the city eliminated its safety dispatch center and contracted those services with Centerville.

Under President Donald Trump&rsquo;s proposed budget, the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program could be eliminated as part of $6 billion in cuts in the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). &ldquo;We are concerned it may go away,&rdquo; said Mary Crockett, community development coordinator in the City of Xenia. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t see anything replacing it.&rdquo; Last week in Lebanon, the Warren County Board of Commissioners delayed action on $700,000 in CDBG grant requests until a decision is made on the future of the program. RELATED: \n            \n            \n               Trump budget takes aim at dozens of government programs Dayton has received more than $57 million in CDBG funds since 2007, used to knock down blighted properties, resurface residential streets, enforce city code and help secure and upgrade housing for the homeless, the elderly, veterans and low-income families. RELATED: Dayton, Montgomery County leaders oppose Trump budget cut plan &ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of the most effective uses of federal dollars,&rdquo; Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley said earlier this month. Montgomery County, which received $8.5 million from the CDBG program in the last five years, uses the money for infrastructure projects, demolition, housing rehab and small business grants and upgrades for places to become compliant with the American with Disabilities Act. &ldquo;If that funding goes away, it&rsquo;s going to be devastating, especially in the urban areas,&rdquo; said Michael Colbert, assistant Montgomery County administrator. Trump proposes pulling all funding for the CDBG program, which has provided more than $150 billion to U.S. communities since its inception in 1974. &ldquo;We are going to do more with less, and make the government lean and accountable to the people,&rdquo; Trump said in the budget document. Last month, U.S. Rep. Mike Turner, R-Dayton, signed a &ldquo;dear colleague&rdquo; letter urging a Congressional subcommittee on appropriations to provide at least $3.3 billion in funding for the CDBG program in fiscal year 2018, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition. On Friday, Turner&rsquo;s office said nothing had changed. Other co-sponsors included U.S. Reps. Joyce Beatty, D-Jefferson Twp., Marcia Fudge, D-Warrensville Heights; and Lou Barletta, R-Pa. Dayton is among Ohio cities that apply to HUD in Washington D.C. Other local governments, including counties and municipalities, apply through the Ohio Department of Development Services. RELATED: Dayton&rsquo;s 5-year plan for CDBG funds Greene County is going ahead with plans to apply for CDBG funds through the state, despite concerns about the program&rsquo;s future. On May 4, Kristie Tidd, the county&rsquo;s community development coordinator, plans to outline for commissioners a list of $200,000 in requests, ranging from $48,500 for Jamestown Opera House renovations to $25,000 for a revolving loan fund for low-income home repairs in Yellow Springs. &ldquo;We are proud supporters of this program. It&rsquo;s very helpful to our communities,&rdquo; Tidd said, adding she was contacting area recipients, encouraging them to contact their lawmakers about the proposed program elimination. While uncertain about the funding&rsquo;s future, Xenia and Warren County officials already moved forward with public hearings required to qualify for assistance through the federal program, signed into law by President Richard M. Nixon. In past years, Xenia has received $75,000 to $80,000 a year. Before the cuts proposed by Trump, the city was anticipating $150,000 every two years under a new process begun this year. Xenia officials are weighing whether to pursue another HUD grant, while hoping the CDBG program is funded in 2018, when it again expected to benefit from the program, Crockett said. &ldquo;We may just continue planning for next year,&rdquo; Crockett said, noting CDBG funds provided for loans used to redo the facades of 10 downtown buildings. Warren County commissioners signed off on a list of recipients seeking about $700,000, based on recent annual allocations for projects in low-income areas of the generally affluent county. RELATED: Warren County holds off on $700,000 in grant requests Also, Matt Schnipke, the county&rsquo;s economic development specialist, was cleared to promote continuation of the program during the upcoming Warren County Chamber Alliance&rsquo;s annual fly-in to Washington D.C. MORE: Warren County Chamber Alliance&rsquo;s first Washington D.C. lobbying trip The reaction in Warren County, a Republican stronghold, shows bipartisan support for the program. This year&rsquo;s list is topped by $277,900 for repairs on Cambridge Court, Georgetown Drive, Raintree Trail and Winding Way, streets within lower-income neighborhoods in Lebanon. The program also would provide $160,000 to fix Harriet and Olive avenues and Mentz Road in Franklin and $90,000 for local administration. It also included funds for a playground upgrade in Butlerville, among other projects.

He posted the video clip on his Twitter page, writing, &quot;We can do what we want on our breaks, correct? Child's game, phooey.&quot;Gensler told Inside Edition that he was focused on not falling while wearing all of his top-heavy equipment. The internet loved the officer&rsquo;s effort. -->\n<article class=\"story cm-channel-story cm-story cm-image\">\n\t    <a href=\"/news/national/police-officer-playing-hopscotch-with-child-wins-internet-heart/XFLBUsruP8a994oDgty4BI/\" class=\"story-photo-link\" target=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"/rf/image/Pub/p8/CmgSharedContent/2017/04/22/Videos/4043178.vpx\" title=\"Police officer playing hopscotch with child wins internet's heart \" alt=\"Police officer playing hopscotch with child wins internet's heart \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"story-tease-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"story-title\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/news/national/police-officer-playing-hopscotch-with-child-wins-internet-heart/XFLBUsruP8a994oDgty4BI/\" target=\"\">Police officer playing hopscotch with child wins internet's heart </a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t        <p class=\"story-byline\">\n    \n\t    by\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nJoy Johnston, Cox Media Group National Content Desk</p>\n<div class=\"story-text cm-truncate\" style=\"word-wrap: break-word; visibility: visible;\"><div>While police officers are required to have certain skills, hopscotch is not one them.

Jeff Gore, Albert Griggs Jr. and David Wilson are candidates to fill the seat currently held by Mayor Tom McMasters, who is not seeking re-election. Voters in the primary will cast ballots for one candidate, and the top two will compete head-to-head in November&rsquo;s general election. MORE: Huber Heights to pick new mayor The candidates collectively identified economic development and growth among their top priorities. The Dayton Daily News asked the candidates to fill out a voter guide of questions crafted by the newsroom. Portions of those responses are part of this story, and the full voter guide is available online at vote.daytondailynews.com. There, the candidates weighed in on issues including the decision to forego the Montgomery County Fairgrounds, the role of social media among elected officials, and residential chickens. Top priorities The newspaper asked the candidates to name their top three priorities if elected. Responses generally touched on economic development and growth. Gore said his top priorities are making sure residents have a good understanding of the city&rsquo;s financial situation, restoring relationships with the business community to promote economic growth, and strengthening and enforcing the city&rsquo;s zoning codes and ordinances. MORE: Huber Heights mayor won&rsquo;t seek re-election Griggs said his top priorities are developing effective and efficient city government, strong public schools and continued economic growth for the city. Wilson&rsquo;s top three priorities are revitalizing parks, economic development and responsible growth. Council disagreements In past months, council members have engaged in disagreements, insults and accusations between members. Council members often refer to themselves as &ldquo;old council&rdquo; or &ldquo;new council&rdquo; to describe their perspectives. The newspaper asked candidates to identify the major source of the disagreement and how they would lessen fractures. Gore said he believes fresh ideas and perspectives are good, but experience and knowledge are also needed. &ldquo;Based on my observations, the source of the disagreement comes from differing visions for the city,&rdquo; Gore said. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s great that we have competing visions, and I think there is room for disagreement.&rdquo; He suggested leadership is needed to promote compromise. MORE: Incumbents seek new seats on Huber council Griggs also said council needs to work to find common ground, but he also said he sees the disagreements as each council member&rsquo;s passion for what he or she believes. &ldquo;People with passion are what we need on the council,&rdquo; Griggs said. &ldquo;The question is, &lsquo;what is the best way to show this passion?&rsquo; I believe you work to understand the passion.&rdquo; Wilson focused on the non-partisanship of the council and said his job as mayor would &ldquo;not include divining anyone as working for one &lsquo;team&rsquo; or another.&rdquo; &ldquo;My job as mayor is to treat all members of council equally and with respect,&rdquo; he said. MORE: Dayton Daily News voter guide Future growth The candidates generally agreed Huber Heights should seek measured growth. Gore emphasized taking advantage of the city&rsquo;s proximity to the Interstate highways &ldquo;or our neighbors will.&rdquo; Griggs said there is &ldquo;no such thing as too much growth,&rdquo; but said it should be &ldquo;controlled to ensure infrastructure keeps up with it.&rdquo; Wilson said he believes the city will primarily see increases in residential housing and light industry in the next 10 years. -->\n<article class=\"story cm-channel-story cm-story cm-image\">\n\t    <a href=\"/news/local-govt--politics/seek-next-huber-heights-mayor/FSR8M99tXH6IkvrDrPl8sM/\" class=\"story-photo-link\" target=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"/rf/image_inline/Pub/p8/DaytonDailyNews/2017/04/22/Images/newsEngin.18461985_vote-art.jpg\" title=\"3 seek to be next Huber Heights mayor \" alt=\"3 seek to be next Huber Heights mayor \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"story-tease-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"story-title\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/news/local-govt--politics/seek-next-huber-heights-mayor/FSR8M99tXH6IkvrDrPl8sM/\" target=\"\">3 seek to be next Huber Heights mayor </a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t        <p class=\"story-byline\">\n    \n\t    by\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nWill Garbe, <span class=\"story-source\">Staff Writer</span>\n\t</p>\n<div class=\"story-text cm-truncate\" style=\"word-wrap: break-word; visibility: visible;\"><div>Three candidates for Huber Heights mayor will face off in Ohio’s May 2 primary election.

On that March day more than a year ago, they were seeking &quot;any evidence associated with the delivery and death of a newborn child whether alive or deceased,&quot; according to the affidavit for the search warrant.&nbsp; What they found buried in the back yard - the skeletal remains of a fetus - led to the indictment last month of a 43-year-old woman who lived there. Michelle Frances Roberts is accused of self-aborting in the third trimester of her pregnancy. She was arrested March 29 this year on felony charges of &quot;producing abortion or miscarriage.&quot;&nbsp; The rarely invoked law, written in 1950, prohibits giving a pregnant woman a drug or taking any action &quot;with intent to destroy her unborn child.&quot;&nbsp; Roberts, who remains in jail in Chesterfield, has denied the charges. According to the police, she told investigators she gave birth to a baby boy in the house, but he died afterward, and she buried him in the back yard. Police and prosecutors have revealed little about the evidence that led to the unusual charge against Roberts, who court records show has a history of drug use.&nbsp; Commonwealth Assistant Attorney Shawn Gobble refused to comment on the case. Roberts' defense attorney, H. Pratt Cook III, did not respond to repeated requests for comment. She is scheduled to appear in court Monday for a status hearing on the case, which has alarmed women's rights advocates in Virginia. &quot;It is unclear from the questionable, selective release of information by the Chesterfield police exactly what happened here,&quot; said Gail Deady, the Secular Society Women's Rights legal fellow for the Virginia ACLU. &quot;But it appears that this is another example of overreach and targeting of a pregnant woman in an attempt to shame and punish her for her circumstances.&quot; But a neighbor who saw the police cars arrive on their street said the discovery of the remains near a big tree in the back yard sent chills through her body: &quot;It wasn't right. She should have gone to a doctor. If you don't want the baby, you go to the doctor.&quot; The law has been used at least once before by Virginia authorities to charge a woman with harming her unborn child, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch. In 2005, a Suffolk woman was prosecuted for shooting herself in the abdomen on her due date and then blaming her injury on a man. But a circuit court judge dismissed the charge, saying the law was not intended to punish expectant mothers. It was aimed at the actions of others.&nbsp; Repeated efforts by state legislators to pass a law making it a crime for a pregnant woman to self-abort were unsuccessful.&nbsp; Deady said she is concerned about the repercussions of the Roberts prosecution.&nbsp; &quot;It could mean anyone who has a miscarriage could be subjected to an investigation by police and thrown in jail,&quot; she argued. It was the mother of Michelle Roberts's boyfriend, Danny Coppola, who tipped police off to the missing baby, according to court records.&nbsp; Before Coppola went to prison in 2015 for violating his probation in a 2011 forgery case, he told his mother, Linda Castillo, that Roberts was pregnant with a baby boy, according to police. The couple also have an adult daughter, Lauren Coppola.&nbsp; Roberts, police said, acknowledged to Castillo that she was five months pregnant. Castillo asked Roberts which doctor she was going to. &quot;Michelle told her that she was going to check with the doctor at the methadone clinic because they would not judge her,&quot; police said.&nbsp; Since 2012, Roberts had been visiting the Richmond Southside Treatment Center, where she received low doses of methadone four times a week, police said. Detectives said the clinic director verified Roberts was a regular patient at the clinic, but he had no record of Roberts ever being pregnant. By Castillo's calculations, her new grandchild should have been born around September or October 2015. But she never received an announcement. Castillo told police she next saw Roberts in October 2015 at a hospital where Lauren Coppola had been admitted after a car accident. At the hospital, Castillo asked Lauren about her mother's pregnancy, police said. Coppola, now 21, told her grandmother that she &quot;needed to talk to Michelle about that,&quot; police said, &quot;and that she didn't want to be involved.&quot; Castillo walked into the hospital hallway, where she saw Roberts. She noticed Roberts no longer appeared to be pregnant, police said.&nbsp; Roberts told Castillo, &quot;This isn't anything we need to discuss here.&quot; About a month later, Coppola and her boyfriend, Dylan Kidwell, had an argument at the house on Philbrook Road in Chesterfield, where they lived with Roberts and Roberts's stepfather, police said. Castillo arrived during the tumult. At one point, Kidwell shouted something at his girlfriend's mother that made Castillo suspicious, police said.&nbsp; &quot;You better watch yourself,&quot; Kidwell yelled at Roberts. &quot;Because I know what's buried in the back yard.&quot; Castillo asked Roberts what was buried in the back yard.&nbsp; &quot;Michelle told Linda that the baby had been born in the house,&quot; according to police.&quot;She said the baby took one breath, at which point she passed out,&quot; police said. &quot;Michelle said that Lauren woke her up and told her that the baby died and that she and Dylan dug a hole in the back yard and buried it.&quot; Castillo died on March 12 last year, five days after police executed a warrant to search the back yard of the house on Philbrook. Castillo was 56. Chesterfield County police said Lauren Coppola and Dylan Kidwell have not been charged in the case. Neither could be reached for comment. &quot;At this time Michelle Roberts is the only one charged in this matter,&quot; said Capt. G. Netherland, a spokesman with the Chesterfield County police. Before his mother's death, Danny Coppola, who is incarcerated at the Augusta Correctional Center in Craigsville, Virginia, wrote three letters to her in which he mentioned &quot;Michelle's baby,&quot; police said. The police search of the home and the back yard, court records say, yielded: &quot;human remains; two Samsung galaxy cellphones; a disc thumb drive; a white tablet; and a journal.&quot; The house, where pink azalea bushes are blooming in the front yard, is now for sale. -->\n<article class=\"story cm-channel-story cm-story cm-image\">\n\t    <a href=\"/news/virginia-woman-faces-rare-charge-self-induced-abortion/tiM5UlCQ5owZqHEsUEaU4N/\" class=\"story-photo-link\" target=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"/rf/image_inline/Wires/w2/WashingtonPost/2017/04/21/Images/virginia-arrest-2e21f54a-2689-11e7-a1b3-faff0034e2de.jpg\" title=\"Virginia woman faces rare charge of self-induced abortion \" alt=\"Virginia woman faces rare charge of self-induced abortion \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"story-tease-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"story-title\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/news/virginia-woman-faces-rare-charge-self-induced-abortion/tiM5UlCQ5owZqHEsUEaU4N/\" target=\"\">Virginia woman faces rare charge of self-induced abortion </a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t        <p class=\"story-byline\">\n    \n\t    by\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nDeNeen L.

Now some are adding yet another incentive to attract -- and retain -- workers: Paid time off to protest. Fauna, a San Francisco-based database start-up, recently began allowing its 13 employees to take unlimited paid leave to participate in rallies, vote, write letters to elected officials and take part in other civic activities. Before February, employees could take time off on an as-needed basis. But the political climate -- and polarization -- following President Donald Trump's inauguration called for more defined measures, said Amna Pervez, director of recruiting and retention. &quot;Since there's been such a divide in our country, we felt we should be very explicit about our policy,&quot; Pervez said, adding that the company also provides unlimited vacation time. &quot;We want our employees to know that we absolutely support the betterment of our country. People can take whatever they feel like they need to make a meaningful difference.&quot; A number of other start-ups, including Turbine Labs, Buoyant and Jelly Industries, have signed on to do the same. The new policies come as technology firms and other companies take a stand against the Trump administration's plan to tighten restrictions for foreign workers. On Tuesday, Trump was expected to sign an executive order that would impose new restrictions on H1-B visas, a type of temporary work visa often used by firms to recruit and employ highly-skilled workers. &quot;If you're a tech company, taking a pro-immigration stand is not exactly a bold move,&quot; said Peter Cappelli, a management professor at the Wharton School. &quot;When there's a tight labor market and companies are fighting for programmers, this is a way to say, 'See? We're here to support you.' &quot; Facebook, for example, is allowing its employees to take time off to participate in pro-immigration rallies on May 1. The company, which relies heavily on foreign workers, informed employees and contractors last week that they would not be penalized for missing work to protest, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. &quot;At Facebook, we're committed to fostering an inclusive workplace where employees feel comfortable expressing their opinions and speaking up about issues that are important to them,&quot; a company spokesman said in an email. &quot;We support our people in recognizing International Workers' Day and other efforts to raise awareness for safe and equitable employment conditions.&quot; Facebook could be particularly hard-hit by any changes the Trump administration makes to H-1B visa policies. More than 15 percent of its employees used temporary work visas last year -- a higher percentage than at Google, Apple, Amazon or Microsoft, according to a Reuters analysis of U.S. Labor Department filings. At Atipica, a software start-up in San Francisco, four of the company's five U.S.-based workers are immigrants. Founder Laura G&oacute;mez, who is from Mexico, said it was a &quot;no-brainer&quot; to give workers paid leave to make their voices heard. &quot;At this point in our political reality, it's really, really important to allow my employees to do something that not only affects them, but also the direction of our country,&quot; she said. &quot;This is what democracy looks like: People having the freedom to stand up for what they believe in.&quot; There are some ground rules, though: No violence, or activities that make others feel threatened. &quot;We will define this as we grow,&quot; G&oacute;mez said. &quot;But my hope is that policies like this become the norm. When Google began giving out free lunches, everyone else followed. Why should this be any different?&quot; For her part, G&oacute;mez said, she plans to participate in a pro-immigration march on May 1. &quot;I'll be out there,&quot; she said. &quot;And hopefully the rest of the company will, too.&quot; -->\n<article class=\"story cm-channel-story cm-story cm-image\">\n\t    <a href=\"/business/newest-silicon-valley-perk-paid-time-off-protest-trump/hY2De1kCfijphRYp99zNhP/\" class=\"story-photo-link\" target=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"/rf/image_inline/Pub/p8/CmgSharedContent/2017/04/15/Images/GettyImages-668894156%20(1)-R1gPIhahWQHmS5Tz3iKPsgK-680x383%40AJC.com.jpg\" title=\"Newest Silicon Valley perk: paid time off to protest Trump\" alt=\"Newest Silicon Valley perk: paid time off to protest Trump\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"story-tease-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"story-title\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/business/newest-silicon-valley-perk-paid-time-off-protest-trump/hY2De1kCfijphRYp99zNhP/\" target=\"\">Newest Silicon Valley perk: paid time off to protest Trump</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t        <p class=\"story-byline\">\n    \n\t    by\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nAbha Bhattarai</p>\n<div class=\"story-text cm-truncate\" style=\"word-wrap: break-word; visibility: visible;\"><div>Silicon Valley firms have long been known for offering a litany of employee perks: Home-cooked lunches, free massages, climbing walls and dog-friendly offices.

Ohanian, the co-founder of Reddit, is white. Nastase was not directly asked about Williams, but made the comment, in Romanian and clearly audible, to the other players while team No. 1 player Simona Halep was answering a question about Williams. The&nbsp;International Tennis Federation (ITF) said it has launched an investigation. In a statement, officials said that &ldquo;The ITF does not tolerate discriminatory and offensive language and behavior of any kind. We are aware of alleged comments made by Romanian captain Ilie Nastase and have begun an immediate investigation so that we have the full facts of the situation before taking further and appropriate action.&quot; The Romanian tennis federation declined comment. It&rsquo;s the second time in a month that Nastase has made controversial comments about Williams, ESPN reported. After being appointed Romania&rsquo;s Fed Cup captain in October, Nastase made unsubstantiated allegations of doping against Williams, based entirely on her physique. -->\n<article class=\"story cm-channel-story cm-story cm-image\">\n\t    <a href=\"/news/national/ilie-nastase-under-fire-for-comment-about-serena-williams/DnZ5q2G5fJaz6tq7o5gpiM/\" class=\"story-photo-link\" target=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"/rf/image_inline/Pub/p8/CmgSharedContent/2017/04/22/Images/nastase.jpeg\" title=\"Ilie Nastase under fire for comment about Serena Williams \" alt=\"Ilie Nastase under fire for comment about Serena Williams \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"story-tease-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"story-title\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/news/national/ilie-nastase-under-fire-for-comment-about-serena-williams/DnZ5q2G5fJaz6tq7o5gpiM/\" target=\"\">Ilie Nastase under fire for comment about Serena Williams </a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t        <p class=\"story-byline\">\n    \n\t    by\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nBob D’Angelo, Cox Media Group National Content Desk</p>\n<div class=\"story-text cm-truncate\" style=\"word-wrap: break-word; visibility: visible;\"><div>Tennis great Ilie Nastase could face censure after apparently making a racist comment about Serena Williams' pregnancy, ESPN reported. &gt;&gt; Read more trending news  At a news conference to tout Romania’s Fed Cup playoff against Great Britain, Romania's captain apparently made a comment about Williams, a 23-time Grand Slam singles champion who announced she was pregnant with her...</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</article>\n\n\t\t            \n\t\t        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n<!-- Rendering article, 33, false -->\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n\t\t        \n\t\t            \n\t\t            \n\t\t                \n\t\t                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t                <!-- DEBUGGER: teasibleProperties.tag CUSTOM TEASE check -->\n        <!-- rootContainerSectionId: / -->\n        <!-- rootContainerPrimaryCategory: /Online/Home -->\n        <!-- object: PortalWebObjectWrapper [+      3892#] /Pub/p8/Dayton/2017/04/21/Stories/newsEngin.18481767.xml [ConcreteProxyImpl:EOM::CompoundStory, 2.0.3101085259] -->\n        <!-- cacheScope: ContextMap[_rootContainerContextMap:ContextMap[primaryCategory:/Online/Home, sectionId:/]] -->\n        <!-- cacheScope type: class com.eidosmedia.portal.render.ctx.ContextMap -->\n        <!-- noRootContainer:  -->\n    \n \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n                        \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     \n\n\n        \n            \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n\n\t            \n\t               \n\t                \n\t                \n\t                \n\t                    \n\t                    \n\t                \n\t                    \n\t                    \n\t                \n\t                    \n\t                    \n\t                \n\t                    \n\t                    \n\t                \n\t                    \n\t                    \n\t                \n\t                    \n\t                    \n\t                \n\t                \n\t                \n\t            \n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n\t\t    \n        \n        \n    \n<!-- map content:  This week was another wild one on the ol&rsquo; Dayton-area restaurant beast &mdash; um, I mean, beat.

The Seattle-based MOD Pizza will open a restaurant at 9196 N. Main St. (Ohio 48) with a special promotion on May 9, with a ribbon-cutting and grand opening planned for the following day, May 10. And a second location is in the works in Centerville. &bull;&nbsp;Former Dayton cop to open made-to-order doughnut shop: This story went over VERY well here in our newsroom, which is only a mile or two away from what will soon be the Dayton area&rsquo;s newest doughnut shop on Oakwood Avenue in Oakwood. And customers will be able to create their own doughnut to order, choosing the icing, sprinkles and drizzle. All under the watchful eye of the ex-Dayton cop who is co-founder of the place. What&rsquo;s not to like? &bull;&nbsp;Firehouse Subs cuts the ribbon on its Cornerstone of Centerville shop: Behind only the pizza-restaurant wars and perhaps the fried-chicken restaurant wars, the sub wars are also heating up again.

Other officials said the toll could even be higher. A U.S. official in Washington on Friday had put the toll at more than 50 killed and wounded, Reuters reported. As many as 10 Taliban fighters, dressed in Afghan army uniforms and driving military vehicles, slipped onto the base and opened fire on mostly unarmed soldiers eating a meal and leaving a mosque after Friday prayers, officials told Reuters. The base is the headquarters for the Afghan National Army's 209th Corps, responsible for much of northern Afghanistan, including Kunduz province where there has been heavy fighting. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement on Saturday the attack was retribution for the recent killing of several senior Taliban leaders in northern Afghanistan. &quot;The attack on the 209th Corps today shows the barbaric nature of the Taliban,&quot; U.S. Gen. John Nicholson, the commander of coalition forces, said in a statement on Friday. -->\n<article class=\"story cm-channel-story cm-story cm-image\">\n\t    <a href=\"/news/national/death-toll-rises-140-after-taliban-attack-afghanistan/ZiTgxigp90habcbSYuLl6L/\" class=\"story-photo-link\" target=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"/rf/image_inline/Pub/p8/CmgSharedContent/2017/04/22/Images/GettyImages-671409206-RYkeRL5xE6rhj5OSsV7muJP-680x383.jpg\" title=\"Death toll rises to 140 after Taliban attack in Afghanistan \" alt=\"Death toll rises to 140 after Taliban attack in Afghanistan \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"story-tease-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"story-title\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/news/national/death-toll-rises-140-after-taliban-attack-afghanistan/ZiTgxigp90habcbSYuLl6L/\" target=\"\">Death toll rises to 140 after Taliban attack in Afghanistan </a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t        <p class=\"story-byline\">\n    \n\t    by\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nBob D’Angelo, Cox Media Group National Content Desk</p>\n<div class=\"story-text cm-truncate\" style=\"word-wrap: break-word; visibility: visible;\"><div>The death toll has risen to “as many as 140” Afghan soldiers in the wake of Friday’s attack on a military base by Taliban members apparently disguised in military uniforms, officials said. &gt;&gt; Read more trending news One official in the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif, where the attack occurred, said Saturday at least 140 soldiers were killed and many others were wounded, ...</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</article>\n\n\t\t            \n\t\t        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n<!-- Rendering article, 35, false -->\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n\t\t        \n\t\t            \n\t\t            \n\t\t                \n\t\t                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t                <!-- DEBUGGER: teasibleProperties.tag CUSTOM TEASE check -->\n        <!-- rootContainerSectionId: / -->\n        <!-- rootContainerPrimaryCategory: /Online/Home -->\n        <!-- object: PortalWebObjectWrapper [+    102477#] /Pub/p8/CmgSharedContent/2017/04/22/Stories/cops_n_curls.xml [ConcreteProxyImpl:EOM::CompoundStory, 2.0.3114901891] -->\n        <!-- cacheScope: ContextMap[_rootContainerContextMap:ContextMap[primaryCategory:/Online/Home, sectionId:/]] -->\n        <!-- cacheScope type: class com.eidosmedia.portal.render.ctx.ContextMap -->\n        <!-- noRootContainer:  -->\n    \n \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n                        \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     \n\n\n        \n            \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n\n\t            \n\t               \n\t                \n\t                \n\t                \n\t                    \n\t                    \n\t                \n\t                    \n\t                    \n\t                \n\t                    \n\t                    \n\t                \n\t                    \n\t                    \n\t                \n\t                    \n\t                    \n\t                \n\t                \n\t                \n\t            \n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n\t\t    \n        \n        \n    \n<!-- map content:  Virginia police gave young girls a whirl on the floor last week during the second annual &ldquo;Cops and Curls&rdquo; dance in Norfolk,&nbsp;WKTR reported. &gt;&gt; Read more trending news More than 50 members of the Norfolk Police Department hosted the event in a downtown ballroom for girls ages 6 to 12.

Lowe, 53, will be promoting KFC&rsquo;s Zinger chicken sandwich, the restaurant chain announced Friday. &ldquo;My grandfather was the head of the Ohio chapter of the National Restaurant Association in the 1960s and took me to meet Colonel Harland Sanders when I was a kid,&rdquo; Lowe told USA Today. &ldquo;It was a big deal. I thought this would be a nice homage to both Colonel Sanders and to my grandfather.&rdquo; Among the other seven celebrities who have portrayed the founder of the Finger Lickin&rsquo; Good chicken are Darrell Hammond, Norm Macdonald, Jim Gaffigan and actors George Hamilton and Billy Zane. Lowe, 53, has previously done commercials for DIRECTV. The spicy Zinger sandwich will debut Monday in the United States after a 33-year stint overseas, KFC said. In a video promoting the sandwich, Lowe steps to the podium in his space suit and proclaims that &ldquo;The time has come to explore beyond our known horizons.&rdquo; Lowe ends the video by asking, &ldquo;Can you actually launch KFC&rsquo;s world-famous Zinger chicken sandwich into space?&rdquo; His answer? &ldquo;We certainly hope so. Our entire marketing campaign depends on it. &ldquo;But when we succeed, we will lick our fingers. We will lick our fingers good.&rdquo; -->\n<article class=\"story cm-channel-story cm-story cm-image\">\n\t    <a href=\"/entertainment/celebrity-news/rob-lowe-debuts-kfc-newest-colonel-sunday/hir7qnutOZENAXxHm7rNxL/\" class=\"story-photo-link\" target=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"/rf/image_inline/Pub/p8/CmgSharedContent/2017/04/22/Images/roblowe-RO7rXZc87kE03bcjIAd356L-680x383.jpg\" title=\"Rob Lowe debuts as KFC’s newest colonel Sunday \" alt=\"Rob Lowe debuts as KFC’s newest colonel Sunday \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"story-tease-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"story-title\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/entertainment/celebrity-news/rob-lowe-debuts-kfc-newest-colonel-sunday/hir7qnutOZENAXxHm7rNxL/\" target=\"\">Rob Lowe debuts as KFC’s newest colonel Sunday </a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t        <p class=\"story-byline\">\n    \n\t    by\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nBob D’Angelo, Cox Media Group National Content Desk</p>\n<div class=\"story-text cm-truncate\" style=\"word-wrap: break-word; visibility: visible;\"><div>Meet the new KFC colonel — actor Rob Lowe. &gt;&gt; Read more trending news The actor has played many roles through the years — as Sam Seaborn in “The West Wing” and Chris Traeger in “Parks and Recreation,” for example — but the former Brat Pack member who also starred in “St. Elmo’s Fire” is branching out into fast food.

But reminiscing about effort, determination and ultimately success on a different field had Matt Light beaming Friday evening. Light, the Greenville High School graduate and former offensive lineman with the New England Patriots, was kicking off his ninth annual Youth Wild Turkey Hunt at the Fraternal Order of Eagles near Greenville. Light, himself a lifelong hunter, told the story of dragging a young hunter named Maria Coyle &ldquo;through the mud and the muck&rdquo; on a difficult outing a few years ago. &ldquo;Her boots came off three times. She never stopped. She never quit. She got frustrated. I think we both did. But when she ended up getting that bird it was one of the coolest moments I&rsquo;ve ever seen,&rdquo; Light said. Light&rsquo;s Youth Wild Turkey Hunt selects 16 Darke County residents between the ages of 12-17 to spend a weekend with Light and some of turkey hunting&rsquo;s biggest stars. They gathered at the FOE for the official send-off Friday night. The program is one of a handful sponsored by the Light Foundation. Participants are judged and selected on essays. During the weekend the hunters learn how to use turkey calls and decoys, gun safety, youth leadership and when to take a safe shot. &ldquo;Every year I&rsquo;m reminded of why we do it,&rdquo; Light said. &ldquo;I forget most of the hunts I do it when it&rsquo;s just me. But I can honestly do a play-by-play on every hunt I&rsquo;ve had with these kids.&rdquo; Arcanum seventh-grader Allison Whiting participated in the hunt last year. She didn&rsquo;t bag a turkey but remains confident she&rsquo;ll get one this time with the single-shot 20-gauge shotgun. &ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m getting one this year,&rdquo; Whiting said. &ldquo;It was really fun last year. I made a lot of new friends.&rdquo; Light calls on a few of his own to help make the event a success. Among the guides are Jamestown&rsquo;s Bob Fulcher, a national champion turkey caller, and Ernie Calandrelli of Quaker Boy Game Calls. Through the year Light&rsquo;s 450-acre Chenoweth Trails facility will serve more than 5,000 people. He said he has three local employees on the payroll. The rest are volunteers, like the 40 who will help this weekend as guides, spotters and drivers to get the hunters into the field. About 30 land owners also allow the hunters to use their property. &ldquo;If these kids knew how many hours everyone spent on their behalf they&rsquo;d be blown away,&rdquo; Light said. &ldquo;It tells you the job of the team that I&rsquo;ve got. While I may not have a quarterback (New England&rsquo;s Tom Brady) wearing No. 12, I&rsquo;ve got arguably a more impressive roster with the guys we do have. The work they&rsquo;re doing is really life changing. Some of these kids who have been on the turkey hunt have asked to come back and help out. To me that speaks volumes.&rdquo; About 45 Darke County youth submitted applications this year, Light said. The process opens in December and applications are available at mattlight72.com. Hunters fortunate enough to land a turkey are required to tell the group their story. Embellishment isn&rsquo;t frowned upon. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a brotherhood and a sisterhood,&rdquo; Light said. &ldquo;The camaraderie of being around each other and enjoying camp and telling hunt stories, which is big for us. Every kid that shoots a bird has to get up and tell the story. It gets a little animated and just like every fish gets bigger, every turkey hunt story gets better. &hellip; Turkeys gobble, they look goofy and they taste great. You can&rsquo;t go wrong with that combination.&rdquo; About 10 turkeys were taken last year. Hunters have the option of having them mounted or breasted. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;ll be one of those things they look back on and say, &lsquo;Man, that was a cool moment in my life.&rsquo; And maybe it becomes a lifelong addiction,&rdquo; Light said. &ldquo;You have one opportunity to seal the deal. Hunting is as intense and as much fun as any football game I&rsquo;ve ever played in.&rdquo; -->\n<article class=\"story cm-channel-story cm-story cm-image\">\n\t    <a href=\"/sports/former-nfl-standout-matt-light-finding-success-different-field/OVmLK5DgWwfQM4YoatEbdK/\" class=\"story-photo-link\" target=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"/rf/image_inline/Pub/p8/MyDaytonDailyNews/2017/04/22/Images/newsEngin.18481261_Matt-Light-3.jpg\" title=\"Former NFL standout Matt Light finding success in a different field \" alt=\"Former NFL standout Matt Light finding success in a different field \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"story-tease-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"story-title\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/sports/former-nfl-standout-matt-light-finding-success-different-field/OVmLK5DgWwfQM4YoatEbdK/\" target=\"\">Former NFL standout Matt Light finding success in a different field </a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t        <p class=\"story-byline\">\n    \n\t    by\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t  \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nGreg Billing, <span class=\"story-source\">Contributing Writer</span>\n\t</p>\n<div class=\"story-text cm-truncate\" style=\"word-wrap: break-word; visibility: visible;\"><div>An 11-year NFL career that included five Super Bowl appearances and three Pro Bowl selections provided Matt Light some of his greatest moments in life.

Springfield leaders have said they won&rsquo;t turn the city&rsquo;s cameras back on until the issue is settled statewide in order to avoid driver confusion. The city has no intention of changing its policy, Springfield City Manager Jim Bodenmiller said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d have to go back to the city commission before that happens,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I certainly support that direction, but we&rsquo;ve not chosen to do that here at this time.&rdquo; Springfield has 17 cameras at 10 intersections that were turned off in 2015 once a new state law went into effect requiring a police officer to be present at the time of the violation. Those regulations have led to multiple lawsuits, including one filed by the city of Springfield, that allege the new rules violate local home-rule authority. The city had issued about 77,000 citations between 2006 and 2015, collecting about $3.4 million in fines. Under the new law, Springfield estimated it would have to hire at least 42 officers to run its 17 cameras at 10 intersections. In Dayton, traffic fatalities have increased 45 percent and crashes have increased 40 percent since 2014, city leaders said. The Dayton Police Department has proposed having 10 fixed cameras, six hand-held devices and two portable trailer units where officers would be present to improve safety at high-crash intersections. Springfield hasn&rsquo;t removed its cameras, which Bodenmiller believes remains a deterrent to some drivers. &ldquo;The safer the streets are, the better,&rdquo; he said. In 2007, the intersections with red light cameras saw 90 accidents. That number decreased to 44 in 2014 &mdash; a 51 percent decrease. A year later, the cameras were turned off after rule changes. Overall traffic crashes increased 8 percent between 2014 and 2016 and traffic crashes at monitored intersections increased 13 percent from 44 in 2014 to 50 in 2016, according to the Springfield Police Division. &ldquo;The facts speak for themselves,&rdquo; Bodenmiller said. &ldquo;I still believe in the concept.&rdquo; The city has already seen three crashes with four fatalities this year, Sgt. Brett Bauer said, two more than all of last year. It&rsquo;s on pace to have more than the 10 that occurred in 2015, which Bauer said was the most he&rsquo;s seen during his time on the force. The Ohio Supreme Court likely will consider Springfield&rsquo;s challenge to the new red light camera laws later this year. Springfield is one of several cities that sued. Springfield&rsquo;s arguments against the law were rejected by a Clark County judge in 2015 and the city later lost an appeal. The city then appealed to the state supreme court.

The city of Dayton&rsquo;s case was heard by the state&rsquo;s high justices earlier this year, which could affect if Springfield&rsquo;s case is heard or not. The red light cameras make the roads safer, Springfield resident Francine Goldberg said, but it hasn&rsquo;t changed the way she drives. &ldquo;We stop at the yellow (lights),&rdquo; she said. However, both Francine and her husband, Steve Goldberg, said they&rsquo;re not sure if the right person is getting fined, depending on who&rsquo;s driving the car. &ldquo;It might be someone else driving,&rdquo; Steve said. &ldquo;Maybe we ought to do away with the (red light cameras) and make the fine something stiffer if the police catch someone going through a red light.&rdquo; -->\n<article class=\"story cm-channel-story cm-story cm-image\">\n\t    <a href=\"/news/local-govt--politics/springfield-won-follow-dayton-plans-keep-red-light-cameras-off/ezXk6xwYwnqlvIgUo6nFeJ/\" class=\"story-photo-link\" target=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"/rf/image/Pub/p8/WHIO/2017/04/21/Videos/4042818.vpx\" title=\"Springfield won’t follow Dayton, plans to keep red light cameras off \" alt=\"Springfield won’t follow Dayton, plans to keep red light cameras off \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"story-tease-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"story-title\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/news/local-govt--politics/springfield-won-follow-dayton-plans-keep-red-light-cameras-off/ezXk6xwYwnqlvIgUo6nFeJ/\" target=\"\">Springfield won’t follow Dayton, plans to keep red light cameras off </a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t        <p class=\"story-byline\">\n    \n\t    by\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t  \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMichael Cooper</p>\n<div class=\"story-text cm-truncate\" style=\"word-wrap: break-word; visibility: visible;\"><div>The city of Springfield won’t be resuming its red light camera program any time soon, despite Dayton’s proposal to turn its red-light and speed-detection cameras back on later this month to improve safety at intersections.

It will be a terrific event.&quot;&nbsp; Perhaps NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell will run up the famous steps before announcing the No. 1 pick. Those same steps immortalized by fictional hero Rocky Balboa 41 years ago will serve as the backdrop for the elaborate stage, including a 3,000-seat, open-air theater, being constructed along the Benjamin Franklin Parkway for the NFL's first outdoor draft.&nbsp; The free event is being called the largest fan experience ever produced by the NFL. More than 200,000 people are expected to visit the half-mile area next week to enjoy the festivities. The first round begins Thursday night.&nbsp; &quot;There was no better way to highlight the city of Philadelphia than to showcase some of its most iconic venues &mdash; from the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, to the Franklin Institute,&quot; NFL spokesman Kamran Mumtaz said.&nbsp; Some tourists and residents in the area have been grumbling for weeks about the lack of access to sidewalks and roads, and about the giant stage blocking most of the iconic &quot;Rocky&quot; steps.&nbsp; Visitors won't be able to run up those steps and raise their arms triumphantly at the top the way Sylvester Stallone did in the movie, but they could walk up the steps from the side and they can visit the Rocky statue at the bottom.&nbsp; Joaquim Marquet, of Valencia, Spain, came down to Philadelphia from New York City just to run up the steps Thursday.&nbsp; &quot;It was the one thing I wanted to do,&quot; the 32-year-old said. &quot;(It) was a bit disappointing, but I understand you can't stop everything just for tourists.&quot;&nbsp; There will be a ton of other, fun activities for visitors inside the NFL Draft Experience, which stretches the length of 25 football fields.&nbsp; One of the interactives includes an opportunity for fans to test their 40-yard dash time against players. Adults and kids can kick field goals, run through obstacles or try the new 100-yard zip line.&nbsp; &quot;I will not be on the zip line, but I'm sure the more adventurous will be lined up for it,&quot; Kenney said.&nbsp; Those who prefer to stay on the ground can get autographs from current and former players, take pictures with the Vince Lombardi Trophy and much more. Fans outside the theater can follow the draft on giant television screens.&nbsp; &quot;The NFL is really engaged in the fan experience process,&quot; said Julie Coker Graham, President and CEO of the Philadelphia Convention and Visitors Bureau.&nbsp; The City of Brotherly Love is getting used to major events. Philadelphia hosted the Democratic National Convention last summer and Pope Francis in 2015.&nbsp; &quot;We certainly do big events well,&quot; Coker Graham said. &quot;But to have the NFL choose us, our city, Philadelphia and then to choose the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, and the iconic steps of the Art Museum is kind of a dream come true.&quot;&nbsp; The 82nd NFL draft is returning to its birthplace for the first time since 1961 and 11th time overall. On February 8, 1936, the first NFL draft was held at Philadelphia's Ritz-Carlton Hotel. Teams took turns over nine rounds picking from 90 names written on a blackboard. There was no media coverage.&nbsp; Times have changed. This year's draft received its most fan interest since the event moved from New York in 2014. Chicago hosted the draft the past two years.&nbsp; Philadelphia fans, especially Eagles fans, are known for their boorish behavior. A group of Eagles fans who traveled to New York in 1999 welcomed No. 2 overall pick Donovan McNabb with a chorus of boos he never forgot. Surely, Goodell will be jeered.&nbsp; &quot;Our fans are very passionate and also very educated when it comes to sports,&quot; Coker Graham said. &quot;We support our players and teams and we share our opinions. We know company is coming, so we always put on our best smile when company is coming.&quot;&nbsp; The NFL says the event is expected to generate $80 million in economic impact for the city. Kenney didn't want to put a number on it.&nbsp; &quot;You can't put a price tag on the positive exposure the city gets,&quot; he said. &quot;You can't quantify the value of that.&quot;&nbsp; The full cost of the NFL draft is close to $25 million. The NFL will cover $20 million, and the remaining $5 million is coming from private funding secured by the city.&nbsp; &quot;The pope cost us $8 million and the NFL draft is costing us $500,000, so the ROI (return on investment) on that is quite spectacular,&quot; Kenney said.&nbsp; For Philly, the Hail Mary is greater than the Holy Father. -->\n<article class=\"story cm-channel-story cm-story cm-image\">\n\t    <a href=\"/sports/football/philly-set-welcome-nfl-draft-grand-way/Lvf9dRzJ8J8SXeK3FGGSeJ/\" class=\"story-photo-link\" target=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"/rf/image_inline/Pub/p8/MyAJC/2017/04/21/Images/venue%20AP.jpg\" title=\"Philly set to welcome NFL draft in grand way \" alt=\"Philly set to welcome NFL draft in grand way \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"story-tease-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"story-title\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/sports/football/philly-set-welcome-nfl-draft-grand-way/Lvf9dRzJ8J8SXeK3FGGSeJ/\" target=\"\">Philly set to welcome NFL draft in grand way </a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t        <p class=\"story-byline\">\n    \n\t    by\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nRob Maaddi</p>\n<div class=\"story-text cm-truncate\" style=\"word-wrap: break-word; visibility: visible;\"><div>Yo, Roger, they did it.

Dayton native&nbsp;Brandon Patrick George, a New York based flutist, uses new and old instruments on an album that&nbsp;&ldquo;honors American craftsmanship and legacy.&rdquo; &ldquo;I wanted to challenge myself,&rdquo; George, who still has family members in friends in the Dayton area, told us. &ldquo;I thought it would be so much more fascinating to get different sounds out of different instruments.&rdquo; He is currently raising funds for his effort and recently wrapped up&nbsp;an&nbsp;Indiegogo campaign.&nbsp; Donors can receive&nbsp;CDs, performance tickets and other gifts based at different contribution levels.&nbsp; The yet-to-be named album will explore the concepts of forward and backwards thinking.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am exploring composers that were looking forward with their thinking or they are looking back,&rdquo; George said.&nbsp; One of the key instruments George will use on his musical journey is the platinum flute&nbsp;Verne Powell was commissioned to create for the 1939 World's Fair. Famed American flutist&nbsp;William Kincaid purchased the flute, which was under guard at the fair, according to&nbsp;flutebuilder.com. He left it to&nbsp;Elaine Shaffer, one of his favorite students, when he died. &nbsp; Following Shaffer&rsquo;s death at 47, her husband auctioned it off at Christie&rsquo;s in New York, where artist Andy Warhol was in attendance.&nbsp; A New York antique collector at that 1986 auction won the flute for $170,000, the equivalent of nearly $400,000 in today&rsquo;s money, &nbsp;according to most inflation calculators.&nbsp; The flute has a Dayton connection. George said Dayton native&nbsp;Phil Unger, the owner of the Flute Center of New York, supports the album&nbsp;project and is helping him secure use of the flute for the album from a private owner.&nbsp;&nbsp; Phil Unger and George met through Phil&rsquo;s father, the late&nbsp;Gilbert Unger. While at Stivers, George played a duet with the elder Unger, a clarinet player, at a dinner party.&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I made this connection with him,&rdquo; George said.&nbsp; George says the sound that comes out of platinum flutes is&nbsp;unique.&nbsp; &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t respond the same way as a silver flute,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;&ldquo;You have to figure it out.&nbsp; Once you do, &nbsp;there are a lot of wonderful sounds you get out of it.&rdquo; The &nbsp;other instruments George intends to use includes a&nbsp; modern Verne Powell flute made from grenadilla wood. &ldquo; I wanted an album that I could get as many sounds that I could,&rdquo; he said. George, a 2004 Stivers School for the Arts graduate who first began playing the flute as a fifth-grader at Residence Park Elementary School, has an impressive resume built thinking out of the box. The Oberlin College Conservatory of Music grad has&nbsp;performed recitals and chamber music concerts at a list of concert halls that includes Alice Tully Hall, the Kennedy Center, Cit&eacute; de la Musique and Bargemusic.&nbsp; George has performed in the ensembles of Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra and the International Contemporary Ensemble in Chicago. He gave props to his teacher at Stivers, his friends and a supportive mother.&nbsp; I had these dreams, but I had people that supported me,&rdquo; &nbsp;he said. &ldquo;It is those people, &nbsp;it is those voices &nbsp;that keep you going when it is hard.&nbsp;Of course it will be those that don&rsquo;t support you, but &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t think they matter that much.&rdquo; &nbsp; -->\n<article

Well before the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s, African-American artists and musicians traveled to France to broaden their artistic vision or to escape the daily oppression of American racism.&nbsp; Not widely known, however, is that the traffic went both ways, with French tourists visiting Harlem because of their fascination with jazz, gospel and black culture, even through the rough years of the 1970s and 1980s, when fear of crime kept away many Americans. During that era, my French came in handy more than once, giving directions to bewildered visitors.&nbsp;&nbsp; French-speaking Africans have settled and opened businesses on and around West 116th Street since the 1980s, with Petit Senegal lending the bustling thoroughfare a distinctly international air with passers-by in flowing boubous, shops selling phone cards for cheap calls to Africa, and Franco-African restaurants and vegetable stands offering tropical products like hot peppers, plantain and palm oil. But since the 1990s, a small French expat community, attracted by the romanticism of Harlem, its strong sense of community and colorful history, as well as by comparatively lower real estate prices, has sprung up, and, inevitably, so have French restaurants.&nbsp;&nbsp; Several restaurants are clustered around West 125th Street and Malcolm X Boulevard, still called Lenox Avenue by hard-core Harlemites and still the beating heart of Harlem, with one outlier on a corner of St. Nicholas Avenue that once hosted an unmemorable Chinese restaurant. As a Haitian-born immigrant who lived in Paris, Africa and for decades on Manhattan&rsquo;s Upper West Side before returning to Paris five years ago, I find the knowledge that I can eat a decent French meal on my trips back to New York &mdash; without traveling downtown &mdash; as comforting as a blanquette de veau on a crisp Paris evening.&nbsp;&nbsp; The presence of at least four traditional French restaurants in Harlem suggests in many ways how much Harlem has evolved, this neighborhood that has absorbed successive waves of immigrants, including the 17th-century Dutch farmers who named it after Haarlem back home. Then there were the Irish and Italians of the mid-19th century, and at the start of the 20th century, Jewish entrepreneurs and entertainers and African-Americans fleeing the segregated South. Now affluent millennials, including many whites, priced out of other parts of the city, have arrived.&nbsp;&nbsp; Harlem&rsquo;s embrace of the French restaurateurs has been warm. &ldquo;Harlem is a village,&rdquo; said Thierry Guizonne, the owner of Chez Lucienne. Increasingly, the village has a French accent.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For most of the 1950s and 1960s, the most visible Gallic presence in Harlem was Frenchy, the flamboyant Haitian-born Camillo Casimir, whose Casdulan Hairdressers on 125th Street was Harlem&rsquo;s largest beauty parlor. Frenchy traveled often to Paris to keep up with the latest styles and coifed the hair of Harlem VIPs, including Diahann Carroll and Mrs. Louis Armstrong.&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, in the rapidly gentrifying landscape that is Harlem, the French presence is best seen in four restaurants, in addition to African-owned places with classic French dishes on their menus alongside African specialties, including Patisserie des Ambassades on Frederick Douglass Boulevard and West 119th Street; Ponty Bistro Harlem on Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard at West 139th Street; and takeout sandwich shops like B&K French Cuisine on Adam Clayton Powell at West 128th.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Harlem, long known as the capital of black America, has a history as a culinary destination, primarily for soul food at longtime establishments such as Sylvia&rsquo;s on Malcolm X Boulevard near West 126th Street and Amy Ruth&rsquo;s on West 116th Street. On many evenings, busloads of European and Asian tourists can be seen jostling with the locals for an authentic experience of Southern cuisine. Long gone are Wells Supper Club, which allowed late-night revelers to have dinner and breakfast at the same time with its famous fried chicken and waffles, and Copeland&rsquo;s, which offered chitterlings and Champagne in Hamilton Heights and briefly on the Upper West Side before foundering in 2007.&nbsp;&nbsp; While the bulk of the media attention to Harlem&rsquo;s growing restaurant scene has lately gone to celebrity chef Marcus Samuelsson and his Red Rooster Harlem, launched in 2010 on Malcolm X Boulevard, with an eclectic mix of Scandinavian and soul food (both Swedish meatballs and fried chicken are on the menu), it&rsquo;s no longer difficult to find a decent coq au vin, a confit de canard or a boeuf bourguignon north of West 110th Street.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of the four restaurants profiled here offers its own particular ambience.&nbsp;&nbsp; Barawine Harlem&nbsp;&nbsp; There are no berets or other French clich&eacute;s in sight at Barawine Harlem, on a corner of Malcolm X Boulevard at West 120th Street. Owned by Fabrice Warin, the restaurant and wine bar, with its subtle gray and brown color scheme, rows of wine bottles and subdued lighting, would fit right in with the new wave of cool branch&eacute; (plugged-in) bistros in the 10th Arrondissement around the Canal St. Martin. A long two-sided rectangular bar that doubles as a communal table takes up much of the space in the airy front of the house. Customers sit side by side or across from one another. Those who prefer conventional tables and larger groups can find them in the backroom, or, in good weather, on the sidewalk.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Warin (pronounced Vah-RHIN) is a native of Alsace who first moved to Australia, where he learned English, before finding his way to New York. He got a job as a waiter, studied to become a sommelier and worked for Alain Ducasse and Fran&ccedil;ois Payard before launching his own place.&nbsp;&nbsp; Warin, 44, has lived in Harlem since 2000 and had long dreamed of opening a French restaurant there. &ldquo;I have a passion for food and wine and Harlem,&rdquo; he said. But some investors remained wary of financing restaurants in the neighborhood until Samuelsson&rsquo;s Red Rooster opened a decade ago, he said. Gaetan Rousseau, a film producer and former neighbor in Harlem who had frequently heard his pitch, finally agreed to invest. Barawine is a Franglais word play on the French bar &agrave; vin.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open since August 2013 for dinner daily and brunch on weekends, Barawine attracts a stylish and diverse crowd of young and old, black and white, neighborhood characters, tourists looking for a good meal and suburbanites who want to experience the &ldquo;new Harlem.&rdquo; &ldquo;We have a lot of French people on the weekend,&rdquo; Warin said, attributing the surge of European tourists in the past five years to an article in the French newspaper Le Figaro about black churches offering gospel music.&nbsp;&nbsp; The ambience at Barawine is cool and upscale, with a DJ spinning rap, hip-hop and soul at Sunday brunch, and live jazz Sunday nights and Tuesdays. A multiracial Francophone staff offers friendly and efficient service. Barawine features a standard French menu, including mussels, a charcuterie plate and hand-cut beef tartare. The food is tasty, well presented and reminds me of the bistronomique restaurants in the gentrifying neighborhoods of the 10th and 11th Arrondissements in Paris. The list is international, with 25 wines available by the glass at $9 to $15, and 200 wines available by the bottle. At dinner, first courses range from $10 to $16; main dishes, $17 to $36.&nbsp;&nbsp; Chez Lucienne Just a few blocks north, on Malcolm X Boulevard between West 125th and 126th Streets, is the grand-m&egrave;re of them all, Chez Lucienne, which opened at the end of 2008, two years before the Red Rooster arrived next door. Operated then by French restaurateur Alain Chevreux and named for his mother, Chez Lucienne changed hands in 2015. The owner is now Thierry Guizonne, 40, a native of the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe, who had run a sushi restaurant in the Paris suburb of Rueil-Malmaison before moving to New York in 2014.&nbsp; Guizonne (pronounced Gee-ZONE) said many customers &mdash; unaware of France&rsquo;s increasingly diverse population &mdash; are surprised to see a black Frenchman as the owner. Explaining his origins can be difficult since, he said, most customers have never heard of Guadeloupe. &ldquo;I tell them it&rsquo;s near St. Martin,&rdquo; he said, referring to the popular Caribbean vacation destination.&nbsp; &nbsp;Guizonne said he benefits from the drawing power of the media-consuming Red Rooster just next door. &ldquo;I like to say people party at Red Rooster, but they come to my place to eat.&rdquo;&nbsp; His menu features many French classics, including, on a recent visit, an onion soup, a steak-frites and a cassoulet on a par with what I order in a standard neighborhood restaurant in my Paris neighborhood. At dinner, first courses are $8 to $16; main courses, $20 to $28. The atmosphere is vaguely colonial and a little faded, with exposed bricks, overhead fans, palms and a row of antique mirrors along one wall. Guizonne has plans for an upgrade of the d&eacute;cor and has opened an upstairs lounge with jazz and R&B music for dancing on weekends. He&rsquo;s also considering a new name. In good weather, his outdoor seating area is lively and ideal for checking out the boldface names going in and out of the Red Rooster.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ch&eacute;ri&nbsp;&nbsp; Ch&eacute;ri casts a different spell. In the middle of the block between West 121st and 122nd streets on Malcolm X Boulevard, it is tucked into a row of finely detailed brownstones, most with street-level commercial space, in a section of the boulevard that best displays the grandeur of old Harlem. Because churches and row houses dominate this part of Malcolm X instead of the monotonous high-rises farther north, the spaciousness of the thoroughfare can be fully appreciated here for its generous width and broad sidewalks.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ch&eacute;ri is a couple of steps down from the sidewalk on the ground floor of a brownstone, and the atmosphere is both casual and refined.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I wanted people to feel they are in my living room,&rdquo; said Alain Eoche, 57, an energetic man who lives on two floors above the restaurant. He is a believer in the Chinese practice of feng shui and has organized and decorated the space himself. There&rsquo;s a grand piano, a bar along the left side of the room, a bookcase and a fireplace.&nbsp;&nbsp; The jewel of the location is the garden in the back, a covered space that can be opened to the sky in good weather. Ch&eacute;ri frequently features live music &mdash; a pianist most evenings, with a singer on occasion. The walls serve as a gallery for a rotating roster of French and Caribbean artists whom Eoche admires.&nbsp;&nbsp; Born in Nantes, on the Atlantic coast of France, Eoche (pronounced AY-osh) owned a restaurant in the chic Marais district of Paris for 20 years before moving to New York in 2013.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He opened Ch&eacute;ri in March 2014. The menu includes a merguez lamb burger, and something hard to find in France, a veggie burger. First courses are $9 to $21; main dishes, $19 to $27. Eoche does much of the cooking himself, including the daily special, and the food benefits from his personal attention &mdash; it is authentic and flavorful.&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the other three restaurateurs, he fell in love with Harlem&rsquo;s neighborliness. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in New York, but not really,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The village ambience makes immigrants feel more at ease.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maison Harlem&nbsp;&nbsp; Maison Harlem is several blocks west of the French cluster of restaurants around Malcolm X Boulevard and West 125th Street. On a corner of West 127th Street and St. Nicholas Avenue, it draws a more economically diverse crowd than the other three spots, from working-class African-Americans and Latinos to smartly dressed strivers and gentrifiers, all in a warm atmosphere that recalls a neighborhood bistro in a gritty section of Paris, like Belleville in the 20th Arrondissement.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The background is exposed brick, and the d&eacute;cor smacks more of accumulation than foresight &mdash; a gumball machine, an antique clock and assorted paintings. The bar, on the ground level of what used to be a Chinese restaurant, is lighted by tall windows during the day and is warm and cozy in the evening. It is the center of social interaction at Maison Harlem, with drinkers elbow to elbow on busy weekend nights and the overflow and those waiting for tables lined up along the narrow counter on the opposite wall.&nbsp;&nbsp; The large dining room is several steps up at the back of the bar, giving diners the sensation of stepping onto a stage. You have a choice of picking a table or a leather booth to monitor the bar scene or seats farther back for more privacy.&nbsp; Maison Harlem is nestled at the foot of the hill that leads to the City College campus and its hodgepodge of granite and white terra-cotta neo-Gothic buildings and stark modern structures. It draws a busy lunch crowd during the week, college faculty, students and employees of businesses around West 125th Street.&nbsp;&nbsp; The owner, Samuel Thiam, 45, is a native of Paris who grew up in the southern French city of Montpellier. An aunt and uncle ran a restaurant in the Paris suburbs. Thiam (pronounced TEA-am) came to New York as a dancer and actor, but a motorcycle accident ended that career. He got work as a floor director for television news shows. The hours were long, he recalled, and the job didn&rsquo;t fulfill him.&nbsp;&nbsp; The restaurant, now 4 years old, was a response to a personal need. &ldquo;I had a condo in Harlem and no bistros to hang out for a glass of wine,&rdquo; Thiam said. He found a business partner to finance the deal when a corner store became available. Reflecting a French &mdash; and New York &mdash; reality, location was important. &ldquo;You have to have a corner,&rdquo; he said. He has also opened a wine store directly across the street.&nbsp;&nbsp; The menu and the ambience echo his biracial origins &mdash; his mother was from Normandy and his father from the Ivory Coast. &ldquo;I wanted to have French food with an African panache,&rdquo; Thiam said. The background music leans toward Afrobeat and Nigerian music legend Fela Kuti, but you might hear French chansons at lunch and brunch. There are North African dishes, including a merguez sausage sandwich at lunch. First courses at dinner are $9 to $20; main courses, $14 to $32.

He also has multiple open cases in juvenile court, including charges of carrying a concealed weapon, grand theft and burglary. During his initial court appearance on Friday, Judge Caroline Caroline Shepherd ordered Troutman&rsquo;s open juvenile cases be reviewed and set his bond on the adult charges at $50,000. He was also placed on in-house arrest with an electronic monitor and ordered to have possession of neither weapons nor devices that can access the internet. According to the arrest report, a Palm Beach County sheriff&rsquo;s detective last month monitored postings by Troutman on social-media sites, including Facebook and Instagram. The detective noted that Troutman posted several pictures and videos with multiple firearms in his waist, hands and pockets. Troutman is currently classified as a juvenile delinquent and is not allowed to possess firearms, investigators said. Authorities say he has a history of burglary and resisting arrest with violence. He remains under supervision as a juvenile until his 19th birthday. &ldquo;He is a danger to the community,&rdquo; a prosecutor said in court Friday. Investigators say Troutman posted one video of himself firing shots from a small-caliber firearm into the ground in his backyard. After being taken into custody, he reportedly told deputies he stole a gun from a box stored in a shed at an unspecified residence in Boynton Beach. When asked about the fired shots seen on video, Troutman told deputies he was only shooting into the ground and did not hurt anyone, the report said. -->\n<article class=\"story cm-channel-story cm-story cm-image\">\n\t    <a href=\"/news/crime--law/social-media-posts-leads-arrest-florida-teen/hcENGwulhzCI8h0maBhOxL/\" class=\"story-photo-link\" target=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"/rf/image_inline/Pub/p8/CmgSharedContent/2017/04/22/Images/troutman.jpg\" title=\"Social-media posts leads to arrest of Florida teen \" alt=\"Social-media posts leads to arrest of Florida teen \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"story-tease-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"story-title\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/news/crime--law/social-media-posts-leads-arrest-florida-teen/hcENGwulhzCI8h0maBhOxL/\" target=\"\">Social-media posts leads to arrest of Florida teen </a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t        <p class=\"story-byline\">\n    \n\t    by\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nJulius Whigham II, Palm Beach Post</p>\n<div class=\"story-text cm-truncate\" style=\"word-wrap: break-word; visibility: visible;\"><div>A South Florida teen is being charged as an adult after deputies monitoring his social media pages arrested him this month on gun-related charges. &gt;&gt; Read more trending news  Joshua Troutman, 17, was transferred from juvenile custody to the Palm Beach County Jail on charges that include possession of a weapon, discharging a firearm in public and grand theft of a firearm.

Kennedy International Airport on April 6,&nbsp;CNN reported. It was reported to the air marshal's management days later. The&nbsp;New York Times&nbsp;reported that the passenger gave the weapon to a member of the flight crew, who returned it to the air marshal. But she failed to report the incident to her supervisor, which is required by law, for several days, the Times reported. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t have inept people leaving weapons in a lavatory,&rdquo; Craig Sawyer, a former air marshal, told the Times. &ldquo;If someone with ill intent gets hold of that weapon on an aircraft, they are now armed.&rdquo; The Transportation Security Administration said it was investigating the incident, WNYW reported. In a statement to CNN, the TSA would confirm only that it is aware of an incident involving a federal air marshal on that date, and it is reviewing the circumstances. A Delta spokesman said the airline is also aware of the incident but declined to provide further comment, CNN reported.

In the 2-minute, 40-second video, a woman with her children can be heard crying. It is not clear what instigated the incident,&nbsp;Buzzfeed reported, but according to Adyanthaya's description a flight attendant &ldquo;violently took a stroller from a lady with her baby on my flight, hitting her and just missing the baby.&rdquo; As the video continues, a male passenger approaches the front of the plane where the attendant, mother, and other crew members are gathered. He asks for the flight attendant&rsquo;s name and returns to his seat, WFAA reported. Near the end of the video, the male passenger again walks to the front of the plane. He can be heard yelling to a male flight attendant, &ldquo;Hey bud, hey bud, you do that to me and I&rsquo;ll knock you flat.&rdquo; At that point, the attendant became agitated and gestured to the passenger, telling him to &ldquo;stay out of this,&rdquo; WFAA reported. The man approached the attendant and both began gesturing and arguing, according to the video. The captain and a female flight attendant attempt to calm the situation, WFAA reported. &quot;Hit me, come on hit me,&quot; the male attendant tells the passenger, adding that &quot;you don't know what the story is.&quot; The woman and her family were escorted off the plane and took another flight, Buzzfeed reported. The flight attendant remained on the original flight, the&nbsp;New York Post reported. When the flight landed at 7:45 p.m. in Dallas, American Airlines issued a statement within 20 minutes, acknowledging that officials had seen the video in question. &ldquo;What we see on this video does not reflect our values or how we care for our customers,&rdquo; the airline said in a statement, adding that the passenger and her family were upgraded to first class for the remainder of their international trip.&nbsp;&ldquo;The actions of our team member captured here do not appear to reflect patience or empathy, two values necessary for customer care. In short, we are disappointed by these actions. The American team member has been removed from duty while we immediately investigate this incident. &quot;We are deeply sorry for the pain we have caused this passenger and her family and to any other customers affected by the incident,&quot; the airline said. The incident comes less than two weeks after a passenger was forcibly removed from a United Airlines flight. On April 9, Dr. David Dao&nbsp;was dragged off a United plane in Chicago after refusing to give up his seatto make room for crew members. The 69-year-old physician lost two teeth and suffered a broken nose and concussion during the incident. -->\n<article class=\"story cm-channel-story cm-story cm-image\">\n\t    <a href=\"/news/national/video-shows-confrontation-between-flight-attendant-passenger/nl7NnbHbtDnoOqep9nT29O/\" class=\"story-photo-link\" target=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"/rf/image/Pub/p8/CmgSharedContent/2017/03/14/Videos/3946854.vpx\" title=\"Video shows confrontation between flight attendant, passenger \" alt=\"Video shows confrontation between flight attendant, passenger \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"story-tease-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"story-title\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/news/national/video-shows-confrontation-between-flight-attendant-passenger/nl7NnbHbtDnoOqep9nT29O/\" target=\"\">Video shows confrontation between flight attendant, passenger </a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t        <p class=\"story-byline\">\n    \n\t    by\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nBob D’Angelo, Cox Media Group National Content Desk</p>\n<div class=\"story-text cm-truncate\" style=\"word-wrap: break-word; visibility: visible;\"><div>A video showing an apparent confrontation between a passenger and an American Airlines flight attendant has resulted in that attendant being removed from duty, WFAA reported. &gt;&gt; Read more trending news  Surain Adyanthaya took the video Friday as Flight 591 prepared to leave San Francisco for Dallas, WFAA reported.

No other candidate has filed for the seat, though an independent could still seek the position. Twiss, 41, is a Troy native in his second term on council. He said his goal is to keep the city a great place to live work and play. &ldquo;Having four young children, I feel it is my duty as a councilman to preserve the quality of life for both my family and other Trojans,&rdquo; Twiss said. Rozell, 57, is making his first bid for elected public office. &ldquo;It may sound corny, but Troy truly is a great place to have been raised, to live, and I want to be part of ensuring that continues,&rdquo; Rozell said. Being retired from the state auditor&rsquo;s office, he has time to do the council job, he said. The top issues facing the city include continued economic growth, Twiss said. &ldquo;I want to maintain a strong, working relationship with current businesses in Troy,&rdquo; he said. He said he&rsquo;s seen industries expand immensely such as Clopay, ConAgra, ARC Abrasives and F&P America. &ldquo;In addition to this growth, I want to continue to support small local businesses that make Troy unique,&rdquo; Twiss said. Other issues include safety and crime prevention, he said. &ldquo;I have worked diligently to support the outstanding police and fire departments that we are blessed to have here in Troy. While they continue to receive high accreditations, I want to make sure the departments are fully supported and have the resources needed to be prepared to deal with the changing safety and crime issues Troy is now facing,&rdquo; Twiss said. Rozell said the top issues facing the city include medical marijuana. &ldquo;While this has been decided at the present, I believe it will continue to be an issue that will be brought back to council in the future,&rdquo; he said, adding he&rsquo;d be willing to revisit the issue once the state has rules and guidelines established and enacted. The council recently voted to ban medical marijuana cultivating, processing and dispensing within the city limits. Other issues Rozell identified include the city budget. &ldquo;I believe it is each council member&rsquo;s responsibility to prudently review proposed expenditures to ensure that the city maintains its solid financial footing.&rdquo; Another issue is safety, Rozell said, noting that while day-to-day safety is the administration&rsquo;s responsibility, the council needs to ensure necessary personnel, equipment and technology are provided to maintain safety of employees and the citizens. -->\n<article class=\"story cm-channel-story cm-story \">\n\t    <div class=\"story-tease-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"story-title\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/news/local-govt--politics/face-off-troy-council-fight/N2gf5wse5tIt7h1PBFnhcN/\" target=\"\">2 face off in Troy council fight </a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t        <p class=\"story-byline\">\n    \n\t    by\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nNancy Bowman, <span class=\"story-source\">Contributing Writer</span>\n\t</p>\n<div class=\"story-text cm-truncate\" style=\"word-wrap: break-word; visibility: visible;\"><div>The Republican primary race May 2 for Troy City Council’s 5th Ward features incumbent Bill Twiss and challenger William Rozell.

Bradley Baker, a U.S. airman currently stationed in Germany, has spent the past seven months in Qatar,&nbsp;WXMI reported. He spent the last three months planning to surprise his mother, Dana Tosh, who is a waitress at a Grand Rapids restaurant. When the moment came, Tosh was so overwhelmed that she messed up a customer&rsquo;s order. But the man, instead of being angry, tipped Tosh $100 to take her family to dinner.&nbsp; Tosh decided to go to the Amor&eacute; restaurant in Grand Rapids, and posted that decision on Facebook. Restaurant owner and head chef Jenna Arcidiacono said she received many calls from people offering to donate toward the family&rsquo;s bill.&nbsp; &ldquo;People started calling me and donating money to pay for it,&rdquo; Arcidiacono told WXMI. &ldquo;It's kind of a fun pay it forward story.&quot; Thursday night, the family enjoyed their dinner and ended it with a dessert tray before Arcidiacono told the family that dinner was free.&nbsp; &quot;It's the most humbling feeling I can't even put into words,&quot; Baker told WXMI. &ldquo;This is a job I signed up for. This is a job I do every day. It was my choice. I don't feel I need any special recognition from it; it's not what I did it for. I did it for my family back home and everybody else. I love my country. That's what I do it for. I don't expect any special recognition, but the support we receive is what keeps us going.&quot; Baker is home for ten more days and then returns to Germany. He returns home in July for a wedding and then&nbsp;will return overseas for &ldquo;quite a while,&rdquo; Baker told WXMI. -->\n<article class=\"story cm-channel-story cm-story cm-image\">\n\t    <a href=\"/news/michigan-restaurant-covers-dinner-for-airman-family-after-surprise-homecoming/ZQCOGQajnbEgsYwRTX7jVO/\" class=\"story-photo-link\" target=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"/rf/image_inline/Pub/p8/CmgSharedContent/2017/04/22/Images/GettyImages-670641184-RT9B5DIA9Kx1jt0zMj2o8jN-680x383.jpg\" title=\"Michigan restaurant covers dinner for airman, family after surprise homecoming\" alt=\"Michigan restaurant covers dinner for airman, family after surprise homecoming\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"story-tease-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"story-title\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/news/michigan-restaurant-covers-dinner-for-airman-family-after-surprise-homecoming/ZQCOGQajnbEgsYwRTX7jVO/\" target=\"\">Michigan restaurant covers dinner for airman, family after surprise homecoming</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t        <p class=\"story-byline\">\n    \n\t    by\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nBob D’Angelo, Cox Media Group National Content Desk</p>\n<div class=\"story-text cm-truncate\" style=\"word-wrap: break-word; visibility: visible;\"><div>GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. — A Michigan airman who surprised his mother on Saturday when he came home early received another surprise from a Grand Rapids restaurant — dinner on the house. &gt;&gt; Read more trending news It was a story of one generous act being compounded by another.

They&rsquo;ve put together a really nice team. There are a lot of teams out there that are trying to get there, and we&rsquo;re trying to do the same thing. This is a good way of measuring ourselves.&rdquo; The first test was promising &mdash; until the ninth, when Anthony Rizzo followed a Miguel Montero single and Kyle Schwarber double by slamming the first pitch he saw from Michael Lorenzen into the first row of the right-field seats for a three-run home run and a 5-5 tie. The Cubs completed the rally in the 11th against Robert Stephenson on Albert Almora&rsquo;s one-out walk, Schwarber&rsquo;s single to right and Kris Bryant&rsquo;s sacrifice fly for a 6-5 win that knocked the Reds out of first place for the first time in 17 days. Lorenzen&rsquo;s plan for Rizzo was simple. &ldquo;Challenge him,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I was going to throw every pitch with conviction. I threw with conviction, he swung with conviction. He got me. He&rsquo;s a good hitter. He&rsquo;s Anthony Rizzo for a reason. Stuff like this happens. What separates you is how you handle it. What sucks is that the team played so well. You feel like you let your teammates down.&rdquo; Price knew he&rsquo;d opened himself up for criticism by leaving the right-handed Lorenzen in to face the left-handed Rizzo with left-hander Wandy Peralta warming up. &ldquo;Wandy would have been in there if they had taken the lead,&rdquo; Price said. &ldquo;We had the right matchup. It just didn&rsquo;t work out. It&rsquo;s a second-guesser&rsquo;s delight. We were one pitch away. We just didn&rsquo;t get it done. I&rsquo;m not going to lose any sleep over the decisions. We had the best guy available in there. He was the best guy in that situation.&rdquo; For the third straight game, a strong start by a Reds pitcher was wasted. Tim Adleman set a career-high with seven strikeouts and added a tie-breaking, two-run double, but the Reds slipped to 2-6 on their 10-game home stand. In the previous two games, good-enough-to-win efforts by Amir Garrett and Scott Feldman went unrewarded by a Reds offense that put together a scoreless-inning streak that eventually reached 26 innings. Playing most of the game in a steady rain before a crowd of 29,350 bolstered by the usual influx of visiting Cubs fans, the Reds left the bases loaded twice. Adleman, making his first start after being recalled from Triple-A Louisville on Sunday and pitching four innings of relief after rookie Sal Romano lasted three in his major-league debut, allowed four hits and two runs &ndash; home runs by Jason Heyward and Javier Baez &ndash; with two walks in six innings. &ldquo;It was a little spotty at times, but if you had told me six innings and two runs against the Cubs before the game, I would have taken it,&rdquo; Adleman said. Right-hander Drew Storen allowed the first two runners to reach in the seventh before bouncing back with a strikeout and a flyout, then coaxing Bryant, the reigning National League MVP, into popping out foul to catcher Tucker Barnhart. Joey Votto, who went into the game hitting .350 (7-for-20) with four runs batted in over his last six games, batted twice with the bases loaded and two outs and both times flied out to center field, the second shot a hard line drive in the sixth. Heyward drove his first home run of the season into the right field seats with two outs in the fourth inning to give the Cubs a 1-0 lead. The Reds, whose four hits in the first three innings matched their total from the previous two games, got a spark from their two most effective recent hitters to rally for a 3-1 lead in the bottom of the inning. Eugenio Suarez lined a double up the right-center field gap with one out, and Zack Cozart followed with a bloop RBI double down the left field line. After Scott Schebler grounded out to Lester, Barnhart was intentionally walked and Adleman made the Cubs pay with an improbable drive into the left-center field gap for a two-run double. Javier Baez led off the Chicago fifth with his first homer of the season, but Duvall &ndash; 2-for-25 on the home stand going into the at bat &ndash; got the run back with an opposite-field homer to right in the bottom of the fifth. The Reds capitalized on a bout of wildness to add a run with a two-out rally in the sixth. Barnhart&rsquo;s single was followed by three straight walks for a 5-2 lead. -->\n<article class=\"story cm-channel-story cm-story \">\n\t    <div class=\"story-tease-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"story-title\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/sports/cubs-rally-with-rizzo-homer-9th-edge-reds/F7iFK3ELjVYNZX8zoNfiaO/\" target=\"\">Cubs rally with Rizzo homer in 9th, edge Reds in 11 </a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t        <p class=\"story-byline\">\n    \n\t    by\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nMark Schmetzer, <span class=\"story-source\">Contributing Writer</span>\n\t</p>\n<div class=\"story-text cm-truncate\" style=\"word-wrap: break-word; visibility: visible;\"><div>Despite having watched his Cincinnati Reds lose 18 of their last 22 games against the Chicago Cubs, manager Bryan Price was looking forward on Friday to the season’s first matchup with the — still-weird-to-say — defending World Series champions. “Yeah, we’re facing the champs,” he said before the game. “It’s been a big couple of years for the Cubs.

The driver stopped briefly, and Perez began to yell at them. Fearing for his safety the teen started to drive away but Perez kept following them, police said.&nbsp; When the driver reached the exit gate of the community, Perez got out of his car, ran up to the vehicle with a gun and cursed at them, according to the Herald.&nbsp; As he pointed the gun, Perez instructed the driver to turn off the car and take the keys out of the ignition, according to the Herald. He then punched the driver, walked over to the passenger side of the car and held the gun to the passenger&rsquo;s neck, police said.&nbsp; Perez then told the driver he had 10 seconds to turn on the car back on or he would shoot the passenger, the Herald reports. The victim complied and Perez then hit the passenger.&nbsp; Perez began to walk away from the car but then said &quot;If I ever see you again, I'm gonna kill you,&quot; and hit the driver in the face again, the Miami Herald reports.&nbsp; Police arrested Perez a short time after the incident on charges of assault with a deadly weapon without intent to kill and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, according to the Herald. -->\n<article class=\"story cm-channel-story cm-story cm-image\">\n\t    <a href=\"/news/national/police-florida-man-threatens-teens-with-gun-over-noisy-car/vLOUmX44u85FRN2OtWIUQN/\" class=\"story-photo-link\" target=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"/rf/image_inline/Pub/p8/CmgSharedContent/2017/04/22/Images/pbpost.jpg\" title=\"Police: Florida man threatens teens with gun over noisy car \" alt=\"Police: Florida man threatens teens with gun over noisy car \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"story-tease-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"story-title\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/news/national/police-florida-man-threatens-teens-with-gun-over-noisy-car/vLOUmX44u85FRN2OtWIUQN/\" target=\"\">Police: Florida man threatens teens with gun over noisy car </a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t        <p class=\"story-byline\">\n    \n\t    by\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nChelsea Todaro, Palm Beach Post</p>\n<div class=\"story-text cm-truncate\" style=\"word-wrap: break-word; visibility: visible;\"><div>A South Florida man who became upset on Monday over the way two teens were driving through a gated community landed in jail when he threatened to kill them, police said.   &gt;&gt; Read more trending news Around 8:30 p.m. Mario Perez, 49, of Pembroke Pines, chased the teens, who are 15 and 19, with his car when he spotted them driving in a black convertible, the Miami Herald reported...</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</article>\n\n\t\t            \n\t\t        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n<!-- Rendering article, 57, false -->\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n\t\t        \n\t\t            \n\t\t            \n\t\t                \n\t\t                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t                <!-- DEBUGGER: teasibleProperties.tag CUSTOM TEASE check -->\n        <!-- rootContainerSectionId: / -->\n        <!-- rootContainerPrimaryCategory: /Online/Home -->\n        <!-- object: PortalWebObjectWrapper [+      1152#] /Pub/p8/WHIO/2017/04/22/Stories/042117-other-side-of-opioids.xml [ConcreteProxyImpl:EOM::CompoundStory, 2.0.3109328780] -->\n        <!-- cacheScope: ContextMap[_rootContainerContextMap:ContextMap[primaryCategory:/Online/Home, sectionId:/]] -->\n        <!-- cacheScope type: class com.eidosmedia.portal.render.ctx.ContextMap -->\n        <!-- noRootContainer:  -->\n    \n \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n                        \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     \n\n\n        \n            \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n\n\t            \n\t               \n\t                \n\t                \n\t                \n\t                    \n\t                    \n\t                \n\t                    \n\t                    \n\t                \n\t                    \n\t                    \n\t                \n\t                    \n\t                    \n\t                \n\t                    \n\t                    \n\t                \n\t                \n\t                \n\t            \n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n\t\t    \n        \n        \n    \n<!-- map content:  An Englewood woman said the crackdown on opioid prescription drug abuse is unfair to those suffering from chronic pain.

University&rsquo;s student filmmakers, will be held at the Rave Cinemas at The Greene in Beavercreek for the first time. This year&rsquo;s event, slated for 3-5 p.m. on Sunday, April 30, will be followed by a Q&A with the directors and a reception at Bar Louie, across the street from the theater. &ldquo;This year&rsquo;s batch of films is a very eclectic mix of genres featuring a macabre comedy, naturalistic dramas, a comedic web series and experimental narratives,&rdquo; says Steve Bognar, the Academy Award-nominated documentary film maker who teaches at Wright State and serves as advisor to this year&rsquo;s Big Lens festival. &ldquo;The students have been working on these films for over 18 months, and they are excited to be premiering them here in Dayton.&rdquo; Bognar says this showing will be the first time the student films will be seen in 2K resolution, using the same technology that regular Hollywood movies do. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s another big step forward for our Wright State film program, and it&rsquo;s thanks to the tireless efforts of our new production faculty member Lindsey Martin,&rdquo; he adds. The students whose work will be included are Victor Solo Greene (from Yellow Springs) and his film, &ldquo;Huella;&rdquo; Leah Byrd (from Trotwood) and her film, &ldquo;Hot & Bothered;&rdquo; Sean Mangan (from Xenia) and his film, &ldquo;Bucket;&rdquo; Christopher Blazavich (from Marietta) and his film, &ldquo;Angela Darling &rdquo; and Eric Dickey (from Newark) and his film, &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t even leave a note.&rdquo; &lsquo;JAK&rdquo; was written and directed by Chloe Kristensen (from Waynesville) and a film entitled &ldquo;Louise&rdquo; was written by Haley Shepard and directed by Leighanna Hornick who is from Centerville. Topics range from the aftereffects of sexual assault to the loss of a family pet on a family. Bognar says his students work incredibly hard on these short films. &ldquo;They write, produce. shoot and edit the films,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;They fund all the movies themselves. It&rsquo;s a ton of work, a ton of collaboration, trial and error and dedication.&rdquo; Many of the filmmakers work on one another&rsquo;s films in a variety of capacities. After premiering at Big Lens, the films are sent out to film festivals around the country. Films from the program have been nominated for Student Academy Awards, Student Emmy&rsquo;s and have premiered at top film festivals, including Sundance. Advanced tickets can be purchased for $9 through the Wright State theater box office at www.wright.edu/theatre-dance-and-motion-pictures/performances/big-lens-film-festival. You can also call at (937) 775-2500. Day of show tickets are $10 cash at the door. &ldquo;Fantastic Brass&rdquo; at Art Institute The fourth and final concert in the Dayton Philharmonic Orchestra&rsquo;s 2016-2017 chamber series will take place at 3 p.m. Sunday, April 23, in the Dayton Art Institute Renaissance Auditorium. Conductor Patrick Reynolds and Dayton Philharmonic Orchestra Brass and Percussion musicians will present &ldquo;Fantastic Brass.&rdquo; The tradition of brass chamber music harkens back to Mozart&rsquo;s time. Selections from Giovanni Gabrieli, Anthony DiLorenzo, Philip Glass and Eckhard Kopetzki will be performed, along with works from Gustav Mahler and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. The afternoon will conclude with Percy Grainger&rsquo;s six-movement &rdquo; A Lincolnshire Posy,&rdquo; with each movement adapted from folk songs Grainger encountered on a trip to England in the early 1900s. Larry Coressel from Discover Classical WDPR 88.1 will give a pre-concert talk beginning at 2:30 p.m. Tickets are $22 for adults and $14 for students and children, available at the door. Humana Festival introduces new plays After introducing six world premieres to theater addicts and industry folks from around the nation over a six-week period, the 41st Humana Festival of New American Plays wrapped up in Louisville on April 9. This year&rsquo;s subjects ranged from a problematic wedding ceremony to nuclear proliferation and alien abductions. An audience favorite was &ldquo;Airness&rdquo; by New York playwright Chelsea Marcantel. The entertaining play transported audiences to the fascinating world of air guitar competitions. The show featured Matt Burns, the four-time reigning United States Air Guitar Champion. A touching and humorous drama, &ldquo;Cry It Out&rdquo; by Molly Smith Metzler, reflected the trials and isolation faced by two young mothers with newborns. Two women with local connections made their mark at this year&rsquo;s Festival as members of the prestigious Actors Theatre Professional Training Company, an intensive nine-month program. Alexis Breese, 23, has been interested in stage management since her days at Bellbrook High School. &ldquo;I like stage management because you&rsquo;re in the middle of everything and you&rsquo;re always solving problems,&rdquo; she told me. &rdquo; Your job is to make other people&rsquo;s jobs easier and you&rsquo;re always backstage during the show. Let&rsquo;s say there&rsquo;s an actor in one scene who has to appear in the next scene in an entirely different costume. My job is to help figure that out &mdash; how and when what change takes place.&rdquo; Breese, a 2016 graduate of the University of Michigan, plans to continue working in regional theater. &ldquo;I like being in a community,&rdquo; she explains. &ldquo;If you find the right group of people and the right community and a play that sparks what you love, you really can create something incredible!&rdquo; Anne-Marie Trabolski, who grew up in Centerville, was an acting member of the training company and landed a starring role in the Humana Festival&rsquo;s play, &rdquo; We&rsquo;re Gonna Be Okay.&rdquo; A graduate of the Savannah College of Art and Design, she says the apprenticeship was worth every &ldquo;hard, long day.&rdquo; Now headed back to New York to work as an actor, Anne-Marie says the people she met in Louisville will always be part of her life. &ldquo;I learned so much about myself as a person and artist and can&rsquo;t wait to kick-start my acting career,&rdquo; she says. Steinberg Awards announced The Humana Festival weekend traditionally concludes with the announcement of the winners of the American Theatre Critics Association Steinberg Awards for new plays. At $40,000, Steinberg/ATCA is the largest national new play award program recognizing regional theaters as the crucible for new plays in the United States. Michael Crisofer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Man in the Ring&rdquo; was the winner of the 2016 Harold and Mimi Steinberg/American Theatre Critics Association New Play Award, recognizing playwrights for scripts that premiered professionally outside New York City during 2016. Based on the true story of a boxer who killed a man during a bout, &ldquo;Man in the Ring&rdquo; premiered at the Court Theatre in Chicago. Two citations were presented to Tracy Letts&rsquo; &ldquo;Mary Page Marlowe&rdquo; and David Rabe&rsquo;s &ldquo;Visiting Edna,&rdquo; both of which premiered at Steppenwolf in Chicago. Don&rsquo;t be surprised to see this winning plays show up on Dayton stages in the next few years. Nature Literature Trail opens Love this idea! In an effort to expose children to nature and literature at the same time, the folks at Fairborn Parks & Recreation have joined with the Fairborn Library to publish &ldquo;Hawk&rsquo;s Woodland Walk,&rdquo; a nature literature trail that displays consecutive storyboards along Valle View Reserve&rsquo;s walking path, located off Commerce Center north of East Dayton-Yellow Springs Road. The author of the story is Ann Cooper, head librarian at Fairborn&rsquo;s Community Library. An kick-off event for the project will be held at 10 a.m. at Valley View Reserve, 1097 Empire Court, located behind 5/3 Bank off Commerce Center Blvd. There will be a 10:30 a.m. live hawk presentation by a Five Rivers MetroPark naturalist and storybook reading, crafts, games and refreshments from 11 a.m. until noon. For more information, call (937) 754-3090. Music Men to present Veterans Concert The Miami Valley Music Men, a barbershop chorus that performs in and around the Miami Valley, will present its annual &ldquo;A Salute to Our Veterans&rdquo; concert at 3 p.m. Saturday, April 29. Special guest is Dulahan, a group that plays contemporary Celtic music. The show will take place at Beavercreek Church of the Nazarene, 1850 N. Fairfield Road in Beavercreek. &ldquo;All proceeds from this event are donated to the Paralyzed Veterans of America Buckeye Chapter,&rdquo; says the group&rsquo;s vice president of marketing Bill Gruenwald. &ldquo;Last year, we donated $2,200.&rdquo; Tickets to the event can be purchased at the door for $10. Children ages 12 and under are $5. The chorus has also been selected to sing the National Anthem each year at a Dayton Dragons Game so you can expect to see them on the field.

Astronomy Day at Boonshoft Museum &ldquo;Bringing Astronomy to the People&rdquo; is the theme of Astronomy Day at the Boonshoft Museum of Discovery slated for noon to 4 p.m. Saturday, April 29. Folks from around the globe will have an opportunity to experience the fun of astronomy by observing the sun, moon and stars and visiting displays provided by amateur and professional astronomers. &ldquo;Whether museum-goers want to know more about complicated phenomena like black holes and the formation of stars, or they simply want to know what to look for in the sky, people continue to be fascinated by astronomy,&rdquo; says Cheri Adams, director of astronomy. The museum is teaming up with the Miami Valley Astronomical Society (MVAS) to celebrate the special day with safe solar observing (weather permitting) and astronomy demonstrations. Guests interested in astronomy can learn the proper use of telescopes, ask questions of astronomers, and participate in special activities.

The 43-year-old Bellefontaine native and resident not only fished in his first professional walleye tournament April 12-13, but he won it. And with that, he announced he would be turning over all $15,000 of his cash winnings to the Make-A-Wish Foundation, which grants requests to children diagnosed with life-threatening diseases. &ldquo;To be fishing as a pro on the tournament circuit is a dream come true for me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My wife (Mandy) and I talked about it when we decided I should turn pro and we decided we would donate any cash I earned this year. And since I am living my dream, we figured we would help kids have a chance to live their dreams.&rdquo; The tournament that he won was the Cabela&rsquo;s National Walleye Tour season-opening event out of Huron on Lake Erie. In addition to his $15,000 cash, first prize included a new $46,000 Ranger boat and Evinrude motor. Defibaugh&rsquo;s knowledge of Lake Erie paid off on the second and final day of the tournament. As the boats headed out of the Huron River, almost all turned left to find some of the large spawning walleyes off of the Camp Perry reefs &mdash; quite a long haul from Huron. Instead, Defibaugh turned right and fished close to shore, 5-8 miles east of Huron. &ldquo;The lake was muddy and the wind was blowing,&rdquo; Defibaugh recalled. &ldquo;So I looked for places with better water clarity. I think I ended up just five miles from the ramp.&rdquo; Defibaugh was using deep-diving Bandits with planer boards. His color combinations varied, but a chartreuse head, purple sides and a pink belly worked best. He said the more important adjustment was adding Pro-Cure, a gel scent, on the top of each crankbait. &ldquo;I think the scent was key to locating the crankbaits,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They were hitting it hard; the boards would just rocket back. There was no mistaking there was a fish on.&rdquo; He finished with 64.65 pounds, 42.26 coming on the second day when he rose from 22nd place after the first day with 22.23 pounds. &ldquo;I went west to the reefs the first day and caught one good fish (out of the five he weighed). With the way the wind was blowing on the second day, I decided to stay closer to home.&rdquo; The second-place finisher was Ryan Buddie of North Ridgeville, Ohio at 62.61 pounds. Mike Robertson of Laura came in fourth with 58.53 pounds and won $16,568. Defibaugh, who is a mechanic for CSX Railroad, credits his wife and sponsors (Ranger, Knox Marine, Indian Lake Bass Pro and Reef Runner Lures) for giving him his chance on the pro circuit. &ldquo;I am lucky my wife and kids (three) have been behind me all the way. We talked about turning pro all winter,&rdquo; said Defibaugh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been blessed with a job that keeps all the bills paid with a little left over to put gas in the boat and buy a few worms. And since I was able to get some sponsors, we decided to give it a try.&rdquo; -->\n<article class=\"story cm-channel-story cm-story cm-image\">\n\t    <a href=\"/sports/bellefontaine-man-makes-dreams-come-true/tt4anDSt6Va8kAOBG6fNAI/\" class=\"story-photo-link\" target=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"/rf/image_inline/Pub/p8/MyDaytonDailyNews/2017/04/22/Images/newsEngin.18349539_Defibaugh.jpg\" title=\"Bellefontaine man makes dreams come true \" alt=\"Bellefontaine man makes dreams come true \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"story-tease-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"story-title\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/sports/bellefontaine-man-makes-dreams-come-true/tt4anDSt6Va8kAOBG6fNAI/\" target=\"\">Bellefontaine man makes dreams come true </a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t        <p class=\"story-byline\">\n    \n\t    by\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nJim Morris, <span class=\"story-source\">Contributing Writer</span>\n\t</p>\n<div class=\"story-text cm-truncate\" style=\"word-wrap: break-word; visibility: visible;\"><div>Mike Defibaugh is living his dream.

The 6-year-old Kettering girl got her start on the lanes just over a year ago in the Kids Bowl Free program and recently qualified to the state event. She and her brother, Griffin, 8, both competed in the Pepsi District Tournament. &ldquo;She was very excited about qualifying to state,&rdquo; Julia&rsquo;s dad, Andrew South, said. &ldquo;She has improved so much.&rdquo; Julia now regularly breaks 100 and her big brother &mdash; who also got his start in Kids Bowl Free &mdash; usually breaks the 100-pin mark in two of three league games. Kids Bowl Free is a summer program that has introduced the sport to millions. Last year, more than 2.3 million kids from across the country and Canada took advantage of the program. Participation is easy as parents can register their children &mdash; 15 and younger in most cases &ndash; at www.kidsbowlfree.com. Parents can select the most convenient bowling center and, once the registration is complete, will receive weekly coupons via email for two free games daily. Participation days and hours are determined by the individual centers and are available online. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect them to take to it the way they did, but I&rsquo;m glad they enjoy it,&rdquo; Andrew said. &ldquo;Anything that keeps the kids moving is a good thing, but what&rsquo;s great about bowling is you can do it year-round whether it&rsquo;s hot or cold outside.&rdquo; And, with bowling, fun and fitness can go hand-in-hand &mdash; a plus for parents trying to make sure their children stay active. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, children and adolescents should participate in at least 60 minutes of physical activity a day. Bowling is one way to meet that requirement. And, did you know that two games of bowling engage as many as 184 muscles? It can also help improve coordination and balance. But it&rsquo;s fun, not fitness, that keeps Julia on the lanes. &ldquo;My favorite thing is getting strikes and spares,&rdquo; she said with a smile. The dates for the Kids Bowl Free program vary by center with most running from about mid-May through late July or early August. But Julia and Griffin weren&rsquo;t about to call it quits after the program ended last summer as they joined a Saturday youth league at Poelking Woodman Lanes. Now, Mom and Dad are getting in on the act as well. -->\n<article class=\"story cm-channel-story cm-story cm-image\">\n\t    <a href=\"/sports/kids-bowl-free-promotes-fun-fitness/8pJm5MSrXfYTTR3lxV0AdP/\" class=\"story-photo-link\" target=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"/rf/image_inline/Pub/p8/MyDaytonDailyNews/2017/04/22/Images/newsEngin.18349531_Youth-Leader-Tournament.jpg\" title=\"Kids Bowl Free promotes fun, fitness \" alt=\"Kids Bowl Free promotes fun, fitness \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"story-tease-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"story-title\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/sports/kids-bowl-free-promotes-fun-fitness/8pJm5MSrXfYTTR3lxV0AdP/\" target=\"\">Kids Bowl Free promotes fun, fitness </a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t        <p class=\"story-byline\">\n    \n\t    by\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nDebbie Juniewicz, <span class=\"story-source\">Contributing Writer</span>\n\t</p>\n<div class=\"story-text cm-truncate\" style=\"word-wrap: break-word; visibility: visible;\"><div>From a game in which she didn’t hit a single pin to qualifying for the Pepsi State Tournament, Julia South has come a long way in a short time.

Set in a farmhouse in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, the delightful, zany tale concerns the strife between the introverted Vanya and his more outspoken sisters Sonia and Masha. As the feuding trio attempts reconciliation, a sassy cleaning lady with a penchant for voodoo, a goofy hunk, and an aspiring actress heighten the play&rsquo;s quirkiness, an essential element at the center of many works by Durang. In fact, a Snow White-themed costume party prominently factors into the action here. &ldquo;I really like Durang&rsquo;s somewhat weird brand of humor, but (this play) seems to me more mainstream,&rdquo; said Chuck Larkowski, who portrays Vanya. &ldquo;Yet there are still those off-the-wall moments. There aren&rsquo;t a lot of one-liner jokes in this play. The humor really grows out of the characters for the most part, or at least that&rsquo;s true for Vanya, who is more of a reactor to his more vocal sisters. There are long stretches in which he says very little, which of course makes his eventual outburst all the more effective.&rdquo; Vanya&rsquo;s terrific outburst, an undeniable Act Two highlight and one of the best monologues written in recent years, occurs when Vanya catches Spike, Masha&rsquo;s narcissistic boy-toy, texting during a play he wrote. His rant humorously details a simpler time when typewriters, Ed Sullivan, the Mickey Mouse Club, and non-self-adhesive postage stamps brought America together. &ldquo;The monologue was a bear to learn because the sequence of ideas is so random and stream-of-consciousness,&rdquo; Larkowski admits. &ldquo;But in spite of its seeming chaos, this monologue gives us a vivid snapshot of Vanya and his postmodern angst.&rdquo; &ldquo;The script is extremely well written,&rdquo; added director Doug Lloyd, who staged the local premiere of &ldquo;Eating Raoul&rdquo; earlier this season for BCT. &ldquo;The characters are funny and each one is flawed in their own quirky way. Although they are flawed, each one grows in enormous ways by the end of the show. You can&rsquo;t help but love them. This is a hilarious show with a lot of heart.&rdquo; &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t stop laughing the first time I read the script,&rdquo; echoed Ryan Petrie, fully prepared to strip down for the majority of the play as the uninhibitedly sexual Spike. &ldquo;I grew up on a lake so I was always shirtless. I&rsquo;ve become desensitized to other people seeing me in very little to no clothes. I&rsquo;m definitely not shy.&rdquo; The cast includes Debra Kent as Sonia, Cassandra Engber as Masha, Cassidy Manley as Nina, and Erin McGee as Cassandra. Chris Harmon notably provides scenic design. The best place to find what to do, what know and what to love about Dayton. In addition, Durang pays homage to the sensibilities of Russian playwright Anton Chekhov (1860-1904). In fact, the names Vanya and Sonia are taken from &ldquo;Uncle Vanya,&rdquo; Masha from &ldquo;Three Sisters,&rdquo; and Nina from &ldquo;The Seagull.&rdquo; Also, Masha, a self-absorbed actress, is colorfully akin to Arkadina in &ldquo;The Seagull.&rdquo; &ldquo;I love the Chekhov references and themes that run throughout the play,&rdquo; said Kent who recently staged the local premiere of &ldquo;Luna Gale&rdquo; for Dayton Theatre Guild. &ldquo;Vanya is resistant to change, Sonia lives with a great deal of regret, and Masha worries about getting older and keeping up with a world that is moving too fast. What resonates for me is the loneliness of the two sisters and brother, and how they&rsquo;ve blamed others, and each other, for their non-accomplishments and unhappiness through the years. It&rsquo;s not occurred to them all these years that they are responsible for their own happiness, and that state of mind is entirely up to the individual. (This play) is funny in a quiet way, but can still pull a huge laugh from the audience.&rdquo; Durang&rsquo;s works include &ldquo;Betty&rsquo;s Summer Vacation,&rdquo; &ldquo;Beyond Therapy,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Marriage of Bette and Boo,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mrs. Bob Cratchit&rsquo;s Wild Christmas Binge.&rdquo; -->\n<article class=\"story cm-channel-story cm-story cm-image\">\n\t    <a href=\"/events/performing-arts/beavercreek-presents-quirky-vanya/mLa4SqsecwGYUT9aRUk8XK/\" class=\"story-photo-link\" target=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"/rf/image_inline/Pub/p8/DaytonDailyNews/2017/04/22/Images/newsEngin.18475593_vanya.jpg\" title=\"Beavercreek presents quirky ‘Vanya’ \" alt=\"Beavercreek presents quirky ‘Vanya’ \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"story-tease-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"story-title\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/events/performing-arts/beavercreek-presents-quirky-vanya/mLa4SqsecwGYUT9aRUk8XK/\" target=\"\">Beavercreek presents quirky ‘Vanya’ </a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t        <p class=\"story-byline\">\n    \n\t    by\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nRussell Florence Jr., <span class=\"story-source\">Contributing Writer</span>\n\t</p>\n<div class=\"story-text cm-truncate\" style=\"word-wrap: break-word; visibility: visible;\"><div>Christopher Durang’s 2013 Tony Award-winning comedy “Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike,” a kooky yet touching look at a dysfunctional family, will be presented by Beavercreek Community Theatre beginning Friday, April 28.

He smelled marijuana in the car. It was driven by a man with an adult female wearing only lingerie. Their passenger was a female juvenile whose fake document showed her to be 18. She was, Otto says, &ldquo;not wearing a whole lot of clothing.&rdquo; The adults had taken this 16-year-old from California to Arizona and were heading for Las Vegas. The girl gave Otto the California phone number of her grandmother, who immediately told him the girl might have been in prostitution since she was 15. Trained in interview techniques for such situations, and experienced at noticing people who somehow do not belong together, Otto correctly suspected DMST &mdash; domestic minor sex trafficking. Trooper Mitch Jergenson, 46, stopped a car driven by a man whose passenger was a 17-year-old girl he had gotten to know via Facebook and other social media. He had paid for her ticket from California to Phoenix and was taking her to Las Vegas. She said she was going to be a &ldquo;model,&rdquo; then said she was going to work in a strip club. This, says Jergenson, is &ldquo;the start of a process&rdquo; whereby minors often wind up working the streets. Sgt. Scott Reutter, 47, who watches the motels near the Phoenix intersection of I-17 and I-10, where prostitutes are active, approached a young girl talking to an older man. She said she was 22. Reutter, whose daughters are 22 and 19, thought she was &ldquo;14, maybe 15.&rdquo; She had been a runaway for 17 months, since she was 13, and said that if she were returned to the custody of child services she would run again. After a 10-minute hearing, she was returned. She immediately ran, and did so repeatedly. To be in law enforcement is often to feel condemned to bailing an ocean with a thimble. Frank Milstead, too, knows how Sisyphus felt. When nature designed him, it had a director of the Department of Public Safety in mind. Large and laconic, he is the 54-year-old son of a Phoenix cop and he knows in the marrow of his bones that &ldquo;there are so many people out there who want to take advantage of other people.&rdquo; It is unclear how many victims of DMST there are because for many reasons the crime is not often reported by its victims. They are, Milstead says, usually abducted, sort of, from &ldquo;some environment where nobody missed them,&rdquo; adding, however, that traffickers cannot control &ldquo;people who are unwilling.&rdquo; But many trafficked minors, &ldquo;who no one had made to feel valuable,&rdquo; are, Milstead says, &ldquo;chronic runaways&rdquo; with attenuated capacities for self-determination. Milstead&rsquo;s troopers patrol motel parking lots and get to know those who do the motels&rsquo; housekeeping and notice suspicious activity. Troopers also watch bars and nightclubs where minors are offered for sex, and, increasingly, monitor the internet and social media. The website Backpage, whose founders live in Arizona, began as a place for normal classified advertising but, a U.S. Senate investigation concluded, found its most lucrative business being a sexual marketplace. The New York Times reports that law enforcement officials say Backpage&rsquo;s &ldquo;dating section&rdquo; often &ldquo;used teasers like &lsquo;Amber alert&rsquo; and &lsquo;Lolita&rsquo; to signal that children were for sale.&rdquo; Holding up his smartphone, Milstead, whose vocation reinforces his inclination to look on the dark side, says: &ldquo;Leaving your kid alone at night in his room with this?

Listed for $189,900 by Irongate Inc. Realtors, the home at 2292 Polo Park Drive has about 2,200 square feet of living space plus a finished basement. Dark hardwood flooring fills the entryway of the home and wraps around the formal living room into the center of the home where the family room, breakfast room and kitchen are all open to each other. The extended kitchen and breakfast room add to the openness of the living space. Along one wall are cherry cabinets with granite countertops surrounding stainless-steel appliances. A window is above the double sink and a double-door panty closet is near the arched walkway into the formal dining room, which has a tray ceiling. A glass door between the kitchen and the breakfast room opens out to a wood deck, which has steps that lead down to a smaller wood deck and the fenced back yard. The semi-private back yard is deep and has a storage shed. The home&rsquo;s breakfast room has a cathedral ceiling and several windows that allows plenty of natural light into the breakfast room and filters into the family room. Tucked into a corner of the family room is a gas fireplace with fluted wood mantel and ceramic-tile surround and hearth. Off the family room through an arched walkway are a laundry room equipped with a washer and dryer, a half bathroom and access to the two-car garage. A door off the family room leads to the finished basement. Most of the basement is one large recreation room with overhead and sconce lights and carpeting. There is a closet under the staircase and a finished bonus room, which is large enough for a hobby or office area. Unfinished space has the home&rsquo;s mechanical systems. The second level features four bedrooms and two full bathrooms. The main bedroom has a cathedral ceiling with ceiling paddle fan. The bathroom is divided with a dressing area that has a double-sink vanity and walk-in closet. The other half has a walk-in shower with glass doors. Three other bedrooms have ceiling paddle fans and double sliding-door closets. The guest bath features a whirlpool tub/shower and extended-counter vanity with single sink. MIAMI TWP.

The true story that accompanies each instrument is a testament to the horrors of Nazi Germany, to the power of music and to the survival of the human spirit. Those of us who saw the exhibit at Cleveland&rsquo;s Maltz Museum learned that for Jews facing unbelievable evil, the music of a violin could offer refuge, hope and give expression to their In some instances, the ability to play the violin helped save lives. Thanks to the generosity of local survivor Bob Kahn, the Miami Valley has its own violin treasure. The Butler Twp. man&rsquo;s beloved violin &mdash; and his story &mdash; are on display at the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force as part of an exhibition entitled &ldquo; Prejudice and Memory.&rdquo; RELATED: Holocaust survivor&rsquo;s forgiveness mission earns Indiana honor At 93, Robert Kahn is one of only a handful of survivors still living in Dayton. He has just published his autobiography and will share reflections as the featured speaker at the Greater Dayton Yom Hashoah Remembrance today &mdash; Sunday, April 23 &mdash; at Temple Beth Or in Kettering. The annual event free and is open to the public. &ldquo;There will come a time when all of the survivors of the Holocaust are gone,&rdquo; Kahn says. &ldquo;We need to make sure that their memories will continue.&rdquo; A conversation with Bob Kahn By the age of 15, Kahn &mdash; who was living with his family in Mannheim, Germany &mdash; had already been stripped of many aspects of everyday life &mdash; his school, his friends, the pleasures of walking, swimming, playing outside and all forms of entertainment. &ldquo;We were practically under house arrest,&rdquo; he remembers. &ldquo;My leisure time was confined to my stamp collection, reading and having a Jewish musician come to our house to teach me how to play the violin. It was one of the things Hitler had not been able to control when our economic and social life had been curtailed by law.&rdquo; Q. How did that violin come to play such a significant role in your life? A. In 1938 on Nov. 9th and 10th &mdash; known as the &lsquo;Night of the Broken Glass&rsquo; &mdash; all of the Jewish homes and 1,200 synagogues were destroyed. Our home was ransacked by the Nazis &mdash; everything in it was thrown from our balcony and set on fire. My father was beaten with clubs and I was ordered by the S.S. to play my violin for the amusement of the crowd that was watching below. They were all laughing and enjoying themselves. That night, my father was taken away to Dachau, a concentration camp. One of the few things left in our home was my violin. I lovingly covered it with a red bedspread that the Nazis had overlooked and hid it in the attic. Years later, when I came back as an American soldier after World War II, I contacted our former janitor from the apartment building and inquired whether he had found a violin in the attic. Weeks later a package arrived in Dayton with my violin still wrapped in the red bedspread. RELATED: Artwork Nazis stole in WWII returning to Jewish owner&rsquo;s heir I placed in in our attic above the garage. For many years, no one knew that my precious violin was there. Q. When did you decide to take the violin out of the attic and share your story? A. I haven&rsquo;t played a violin since that day in 1938. I just couldn&rsquo;t. But when I joined Dayton&rsquo;s Holocaust Education Committee, I took the violin to show the group. After that, it became the centerpiece of talks I began to give at schools and on other occasions. When the Air Force Museum decided to install an exhibit dealing with the Holocaust, I decided to give my violin a meaningful resting place where its story could be permanently displayed. Q.\n            I understand you will be speaking on a different subject at this year&rsquo;s Holocaust memorial? A. Yes, I fought with the U.S. Army in the Pacific. In 1946 I was living in Chicago and saw a newspaper ad asking for people who could speak and understand technical German. I got the job and came to Dayton to work for &ldquo;Project Paperclip,&rdquo; a top secret program conducted by a U.S. intelligence agency at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. The purpose was to gain military advantages over the Soviet Union in the Cold War, and the space race. Approximately 80 German aeronautical experts were brought to the base and they were interrogated about their contributions to German Air Force developments, production, related weapons and technology. Their background was never revealed but we assumed that most of them were Nazis. That posed difficulties because of my background. It was difficult for me to have anything but a professional relationship with them. READ NOW: Germany approves bill curbing online hate crime, fake news They didn&rsquo;t talk about it but through documents and microfilm, I saw evidence of the cruel tests performed on human being by Nazi scientists, engineers and doctors. The general public is unaware of the ways in which these helpless individuals died. It is those heroic Jews who were ruthlessly murdered that I want to memorialize. Q.\n            Tell us about your book and why you wrote it. A. My children and grandchildren constantly ask me questions about my life. Over the years, I only gave them fragmentary replies. I realized that in order to satisfy their curiosity I needed to write a detailed autobiography &mdash; about my ancestors, my parents and sister, my young life and the 18 relatives who lost their lives in the Holocaust. I wanted to write about my escape to freedom, my life in America and service as an American solider, my work with Army intelligence. I wrote about my marriage to my wife, Gert &mdash; who I met at a USO gathering where she was a volunteer &mdash; about my children and grandchildren. My first great-grandchild was born two weeks ago. Q.\n            The title of your book is &ldquo;The Hard Road of Dreams.&rdquo; What does that mean to you? A. I was always dreaming about a wonderful life. In retrospect I came to realize that I was leading a wonderful life. But the road to get there was fraught with all sorts of tragic events. The subtitle is &ldquo;Remembering Not to Forget.&rdquo; Q. What lessons can others learn from your story? Your violin? A. I hope that they can learn to resist any indifference to anti-semitism and other forms of religious and racial hatred. This is especially important for young people because they will become the caretakers of our nation. They can use their voices to reject evil. They will have an impact on their world and can help minimize, if not curtail, the slaughter of innocent people in other parts of the world. -->\n<article class=\"story cm-channel-story cm-story cm-image\">\n\t    <a href=\"/events/performing-arts/survivor-bob-kahn-will-speak-holocaust-memorial-event/UK9UxURcy1dz2IByj0iEfJ/\" class=\"story-photo-link\" target=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"/rf/image_inline/Pub/p8/MyDaytonDailyNews/2017/04/22/Images/newsEngin.18209670_IMG_3930.jpg\" title=\"Survivor Bob Kahn will speak at Holocaust memorial event \" alt=\"Survivor Bob Kahn will speak at Holocaust memorial event \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"story-tease-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"story-title\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/events/performing-arts/survivor-bob-kahn-will-speak-holocaust-memorial-event/UK9UxURcy1dz2IByj0iEfJ/\" target=\"\">Survivor Bob Kahn will speak at Holocaust memorial event </a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t        <p class=\"story-byline\">\n    \n\t    by\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t  \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMeredith Moss, <span class=\"story-source\">Staff Writer</span>\n\t</p>\n<div class=\"story-text cm-truncate\" style=\"word-wrap: break-word; visibility: visible;\"><div>Many of us were first introduced to the “Violins of Hope” when the historic instruments were featured on the popular television show, “CBS Sunday Morning.” The 20 restored violins, which continue to be exhibited and played throughout the world, once belonged to victims of the Holocaust.

Listed for $348,500 by Wright-Patt Realty Inc., the brick-and-vinyl home at 2920 Torrey Pines Drive has about 2,970 square feet of living space. The house sits diagonally on a corner lot with extra parking pad near the two-car garage. The location is tucked back within the neighborhood on a cul-de-sac. Formal entry opens into a two-story foyer with an open staircase that has oak spindle accents. An arched window is above the door allowing natural light into the upstairs cat-walk hallway. French doors to the left open to an office area and to the right are the formal living and dining rooms. The dining room, which is at the back off the house and accessible from the kitchen, has a tray ceiling with crown molding. The oak flooring flows from the foyer down the central hallway and fills the more casual living space, including the family room, kitchen and morning room. Several windows with transoms above fill the family room with natural light and a gas fireplace has an oak mantel with ceramic accents. A door off the family room opens to the laundry room, which also provides access to the garage. An island that can seat six is the focal point of the kitchen. The island offers extra counter space and storage as well as the seating. The kitchen is equipped with stainless-steel appliances, which were updated within the last year, and has a pantry closet. A double sink is within the lower counter of the dual surface peninsula counter that divides the kitchen from the morning room. The morning room has a cathedral ceiling and patio doors that open to a deck and open back yard. Upstairs, double doors open into the main bedroom, which has a walk-in closet, sitting area and a cathedral ceiling. The private bathroom has a ceramic-tile surround shower, an oval soaking tub below a window, a double-sink vanity and vaulted ceiling. One bedroom has hardwood flooring while the others have carpeting. Three bedrooms have double door closets and the guest bath features a tub/shower and double-sink vanity. Other features include dual air-conditioning units for the main and upper levels, an irrigation system and security system. The roof was replaced in 2012.

said owner Christine Carter. &ldquo;We added hardwood floors, extra windows and a morning room, and we upgraded the kitchen.&rdquo; The kitchen upgrades include granite counters and oversized cabinets. This two-story home, which offers about 3,775 square feet of living space, is listed for $280,000 by Ed Blankenship and the Jamie Day Team of Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate/Big Hill. Blankenship said, &ldquo;This two-story home features 9-foot ceilings on the main floor.&rdquo; Fluted pilasters and a decorative pediment frame the front door, which opens into an entry warmed by hardwood flooring that extends left and right into the open living room and the office. Roman-style shades have been installed at most of the windows on the main level. Two-panel interior doors throughout the house have lever handles. At the end of the entry the family room is enhanced with neutral inset carpet, a gas fireplace with a white mantel and recessed ceiling lights. A peninsular counter provides bar seating at the entrance to the open kitchen and creates a separation from the open morning room with a partial counter tiered above the double sink. This open gathering area is where the Carters spend most of their time. &ldquo;This is pretty much our strip,&rdquo; Carter said. &ldquo;The morning room is nice. We cook together and eat together.&rdquo; Counter space wraps around the corner of the work space along with oversized wood cabinets that complement the hardwood flooring. Stainless-steel appliances include the four-burner gas range, a side-by-side refrigerator and the dishwasher. The door to the walk-in pantry is angled in one corner. Five windows with Roman shades surround the morning room, which has sliding glass doors that open to the deck. An archway on the opposite side of the family room leads into a private and versatile extra room, which is currently used as a bedroom but could serve for other uses, such as a second office. Nearby is a half-bath with a pedestal sink. There is a coat closet near the exit door to the attached two-car garage. The spindled railing that edges the staircase extends along the carpeted hallway on the upper level, which boasts five bedrooms. Blankenship said, &ldquo;All the bedrooms are oversized.&rdquo; In the main bedroom suite double windows meet at a corner and are shaded with wide-slat blinds. In the adjacent bath the raised double vanity is recessed into an alcove. The oval garden tub is set in paneling and surrounded with a backsplash in ceramic tile. Walls around the separate shower are covered with ceramic tile, also. A glass door encloses the shower, which has a bench seat/shelf. Wraparound organizers are installed in the walk-in closet. The largest upstairs room is used as a play room. It has an arched dormer area and two closets. Bedrooms three, four and five are near the hall bath, which has a tub and shower combination and a double vanity. There is a deep linen/storage closet in the hall. Another linen closet is in the nearby laundry room, which has a wall storage shelf above the washer/dryer hookups. In the finished portion of the basement is a recreation room with neutral carpet and recessed ceiling lights. The full bath on this level has a step-in, low-entry shower and a raised vanity. An otherwise unfinished room has a dry-walled ceiling and is used for exercise. There is plenty of storage space in the unfinished utility room.

The large piece of debris blew out a back tire on the car, causing her to lose control and swerve into another lane on the highway. &ldquo;I was able to control my car. I was blessed,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve ever blown out your tire, you know it&rsquo;s really hard to control it.&rdquo; The damage to her vehicle &mdash; including a destroyed rim, tire and strut &mdash; cost more than $590. Potholes cost drivers, local municipalities and the state billions of dollars each year in damage repairs, insurance claims and civil complaints. The state has already used 8,818 tons of pavement patching material to repair potholes this year alone. That&rsquo;s up from the 6,823 tons last year and 4,178 tons used in 2015. Matt Bruning, spokesman for the Ohio Department of Transportation, said the cost of fixing each pothole varies &mdash; it could be hundreds of dollars to thousands of dollars. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll notice that we&rsquo;ve used a lot more material patching potholes over the past couple of years,&rdquo; Bruning said. &ldquo;While we&rsquo;re seeing more potholes, we&rsquo;re also doing a better job fixing them as quickly as we can.&rdquo; Gros said the pothole was fixed the next day after her accident, and that the crews had responded quickly and appropriately. The state has already spent $4.06 million to fill potholes. The department does not track data on how many potholes are repaired each year. &ldquo;If it is a more permanent fix, you will have a bigger crew, more equipment, more expensive asphalt,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In the permanent fix you will cut out the damaged material. You make the cuts just outside of the damaged area, so that you get a good bond when you put in the new asphalt.&rdquo; Civil complaints can be filed against the state in the Ohio Court of Claims for pothole damage. If the pothole damage is $10,000 or less, drivers can file a complaint with the state court that was established in 1975 by the General Assembly. More than 1,000 Ohioans filed complaints in the past five years and were reimbursed nearly a half million dollars by the state. More than 125 civil complaints have been filed for vehicle damage because of potholes this year, according to a state database. That number is slightly down from a couple years ago when claims skyrocketed after a brutally cold winter with quickly swinging temperatures. Approximately 100 civil complaints related to potholes were filed in 2013, and that number spiked to 355 filed in 2015. Locally, some say the unseasonably warm winter conditions resulted in fewer potholes and damage vehicles &mdash; costing local municipalities and the state less in road repair and civil claims. Fred Stovall, public works director for Dayton, said there&rsquo;s been less this year &mdash; similar to trends seen with last year&rsquo;s mild winter as well. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re always going to have potholes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a mild winter, and we do have some pot holes but it&rsquo;s nothing out of the norm.&rdquo; Potholes are typically caused by weather patterns. Through the winter months, water gets under the pavement and frees, then thaws, repeatedly. That expansion and contraction of water causes roadway material to break up. That action mixed with heavy traffic results in potholes. &ldquo;But potholes aren&rsquo;t just a winter problem,&rdquo; Bruning said. &ldquo;They can happen in warmer weather too. Water gets under the pavement, breaks down the asphalt and creates a void. Then the traffic on top creates depressions in the pavement.&rdquo; Potholes are most noticeable when the temperature starts to warm up again after cold weather, and crews usually have the busiest work time in January and February, according to the transportation department. Mark Breining, manager at Grismer Tire in Dayton, said it&rsquo;s been a slow year for vehicle damage due to potholes. The mild winter has kept more cars on the streets and out of auto repairs shops, he said. &ldquo;The snow was so minimal,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Everyone got a break from it this year.&rdquo; If a vehicle does hit a pothole, it can do extensive damage and cost upwards of hundreds of dollars for repair. A patch repair cost about $25, but a new wheel could cost up to $300 plus the price of a new tire. If the alignment or suspension of the car has been impacted, that will cost even more. While municipalities say there&rsquo;s not many ways to prevent potholes, one local company is working to analyze and disseminate pothole data. Founded by James Bridgers, Road-Aid uses geospatial and sensor, automatic target recognition on vehicles to identify where potholes are at &mdash; and then collect, analyze and inventory data about road issues. Bridgers said the goal is to better help consumers to understand where potholes are at, he said.

Now a political refugee in the United States, Bilici led Zaman Daily, which had been the largest newspaper in Turkey until it was seized and eventually shut down by the party of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Bilici will be in Dayton on May 1 at the invitation of the Dayton Council on World Affairs. He will speak about the fast-moving changes in Turkey, including crackdowns on journalists. The 5:30 p.m. event will be hosted by Cox Media Group Ohio, publisher of this newspaper. The importance of Turkey to the United States and international interests could not be greater, Bilici said. An ally of the U.S. for 60 years, Turkey is the only Muslim country in NATO and has NATO&rsquo;s second-largest Army in terms of troop numbers. The country also sits near Russia, Iran, Syria and Iraq in a volatile, strategic region. &ldquo;Now there is a big chance that the West is losing Turkey &hellip; and Turkey is getting each day closer to Russia and other axes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Keeping Turkey as a democratic country is a very important strategic issue for Turkish people and the friends of Turkish people.&rdquo; Carolyn Rice, an executive board member Dayton Council on World Affairs, heard Bilici speak in Washington, D.C. last November. She said the newsman has a compelling story. &ldquo;I would think our community would want to know Turkey is an important ally and an important country in all that&rsquo;s happening,&rdquo; said Rice, who is also Montgomery County treasurer. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not coming to make a political speech or be talking against Erdogan. It is truly about the topic of the importance of a free press in a democratic society.&rdquo; Bilici described Zaman Daily&rsquo;s editorial stance as conservative-progressive, a sober-eyed, middle-of-the road approach for the region&rsquo;s only Muslim democracy. &ldquo;We were supporting family values and we were respecting religious values and traditional values of Turkish society. This was our conservative aspect,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But under the progressive aspect, we were defending the rule of law and democracy and Turkey joining the European Union. So it was a combination of both sides.&rdquo; The Istanbul-based paper first supported Erdogan&rsquo;s efforts as a prime minister pushing democratic ideals and inclusion in the European Union, Bilici said. But the paper&rsquo;s editorial stance shifted as Erdogan&rsquo;s party pressured, purged or jailed protesters, journalists and prosecutors as well as others the ruling AKP party saw as threats through a 2013 corruption scandal. Erdogan&rsquo;s government labeled the paper, among others, a terrorist organization. On March 4, 2016, troops stormed the building and took over the presses. Bilici left Turkey about 15 days later. Speaking by phone last week, he said family members are with him in the U.S. but declined to discuss where they are living due to security concerns. Bilici said none of the paper&rsquo;s columnists&rsquo; views &ndash; whether nationalist, conservative, progressive or leftist &ndash; could find favor with Erdogan&rsquo;s government. Fifty journalists from the paper &ndash; including those who worked to objectively cover the news &ndash; are currently jailed, he said. At least 81 journalists were imprisoned in Turkey as of Dec. 1, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Two years after Erdogan became president, a military faction attempted a 2016 coup, and the government declared a national emergency. Bilici said resulting restrictions made work even more difficult for even-handed newsgatherers. &ldquo;The failed coup last July was also an important last turning point that he started to rule the country by emergency that is now continuing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Erdogan is using that as an opportunity to silence any position, leftist, liberal or conservative, nationalist, whatever.&rdquo; Erdogan now controls 90 percent of the Turkish media, Bilici argues, making it easier to consolidate power in elections such as one a week ago that could result in abolishment of the country&rsquo;s existing parliamentary system of government. He also said he detects a similarity in the way some in the U.S. media have been treated at the White House following the election of President Donald Trump, when some reporters were barred from press briefings. &ldquo;There are some parallels, but of course America has a much stronger tradition of democracy and very important, strong institutions,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There is a common understanding in the United States to defend freedom of expression, although those newspapers and media don&rsquo;t agree on political issues.&rdquo; Bilici said in just five short years Turkey&rsquo;s democracy was &ldquo;hijacked&rdquo; by Erdogan&rsquo;s party, resulting in a muzzled press and judiciary. He hopes those parallels don&rsquo;t stretch too far. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that America will start jailing its journalists &ndash; I hope it doesn&rsquo;t go that far &ndash; but the people should be ready to defend democracy by defending freedom of expression and an independent judiciary,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Because when you lose those two, you don&rsquo;t have a chance to defend democracy. These are red lines.&rdquo; -->\n<article class=\"story cm-channel-story cm-story \">\n\t    <div class=\"story-tease-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"story-title\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/news/former-turkish-editor-share-story-country-break-from-democracy/mt76BkBhepXZUah8FJFzAO/\" target=\"\">Former Turkish editor to share story of country’s ‘break from democracy’ </a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t        <p class=\"story-byline\">\n    \n\t    by\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t  \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nChris Stewart, <span class=\"story-source\">Staff Writer</span>\n\t</p>\n<div class=\"story-text cm-truncate\" style=\"word-wrap: break-word; visibility: visible;\"><div>The former editor of a once-prominent Turkish newspaper is worried the rich, diverse country at the crossroads of Europe and Asia is drifting toward an autocratic ruler with little regard for preserving freedoms of expression – including a free press – conditions that allowed Turkey to flourish as a secular democracy. “I am a witness and a victim of Turkey’s break from democracy...</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</article>\n\n\t\t            \n\t\t        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n<!-- Rendering article, 72, false -->\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n\t\t        \n\t\t            \n\t\t            \n\t\t                \n\t\t                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t                <!-- DEBUGGER: teasibleProperties.tag CUSTOM TEASE check -->\n        <!-- rootContainerSectionId: / -->\n        <!-- rootContainerPrimaryCategory: /Online/Home -->\n        <!-- object: PortalWebObjectWrapper [+      4076#] /Pub/p8/MyDaytonDailyNews/2017/04/22/Stories/newsEngin.18349429.xml [ConcreteProxyImpl:EOM::CompoundStory, 2.0.3098136951] -->\n        <!-- cacheScope: ContextMap[_rootContainerContextMap:ContextMap[primaryCategory:/Online/Home, sectionId:/]] -->\n        <!-- cacheScope type: class com.eidosmedia.portal.render.ctx.ContextMap -->\n        <!-- noRootContainer:  -->\n    \n \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n                        \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     \n\n\n        \n            \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n\n\t            \n\t               \n\t                \n\t                \n\t                \n\t                    \n\t                    \n\t                \n\t                    \n\t                    \n\t                \n\t                    \n\t                    \n\t                \n\t                    \n\t                    \n\t                \n\t                    \n\t                    \n\t                \n\t                    \n\t                    \n\t                \n\t                    \n\t                    \n\t                \n\t                    \n\t                    \n\t                \n\t                    \n\t                    \n\t                \n\t                    \n\t                    \n\t                \n\t                    \n\t                    \n\t                \n\t                \n\t                \n\t            \n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n\t\t    \n        \n        \n    \n<!-- map content:  In the latest example of fascinating Major League Baseball statistics, studies show that a 29-year-old centerfielder saves an average of four fewer runs per season than a 28-year-old centerfielder, The New York Times reported this week. While you may wonder why a prestigious newspaper would use valuable space to report stuff like that, baseball fans take such statistics seriously. And no statistic is too trivial to report. Somewhere in baseball&rsquo;s huge trove of baseball records, there may be one for &ldquo;Most errors committed by a left-handed shortstop born in Alaska.&rdquo; (This is a hyperbolic example. Only 11 of the 18,672 players in the history of baseball was born in Alaska, none of whom was a left-handed shortstop.) Talking about statistics gives fans something to do when nothing&rsquo;s happening on the field, which is most of the time. In an average three-hour game, according to one study, there are nine minutes and 45 seconds of actual activity. Unless you count players jogging to and from their dugouts as actual activity. MORE D.L.: Just &lsquo;plane&rsquo; carried away at the doctor&rsquo;s office. Now that most baseball fans in the stands are armed with cellphones, they don&rsquo;t have to wait to get home to their computers to savor the thrill of baseball statistics. Instead of watching a hitter stand in the batter&rsquo;s box and not swing at a pitch, they can Google the record for standing in a batter&rsquo;s box and not swinging at a pitch. Which, of course, was set last season by Bryce Harper of the Washington Nationals, who imitated a statue for seven consecutive at bats in a 13-inning game. Devout fans can use authentic statistics such as the following to engage in meaningful dialogues. Fan No. 1: &ldquo;Did you know Felix Hernandez is the only pitcher who made 16 consecutive starts, pitched at least seven innings and gave up two or fewer runs?&rdquo; Fan No. 2: &ldquo;Duh. But did you know that three pitchers who started 13 games and lasted fewer than seven games allowed at least three runs?&rdquo; READ MORE D.L.: A lifelong goal is inching away. The downside about getting engrossed in these statistics at the ballpark is that fans may not pay attention to the 9:45 of action on the field. In 1957, Philadelphia&rsquo;s Richie Ashburn set the record for most foul balls hitting the same fan (2); the first one struck spectator Alice Roth in the face, breaking her nose. As they carted her away for medical attention, Ashburn hit another foul ball, which struck the unfortunate Ms. Roth in the leg, breaking a bone in her knee. My guess is that she had been distracted by talking to the fan next to her about Cleveland&rsquo;s Bob Feller, who, in 1939, set the record for throwing the most pitches that were fouled into the stands, striking the pitcher&rsquo;s mother on Mother&rsquo;s Day (1). -->\n<article class=\"story cm-channel-story cm-story \">\n\t    <div class=\"story-tease-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"story-title\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/lifestyles/stewart-enjoying-major-league-baseball-the-numbers/foz6LoPk3sMmGBVlnQO3YK/\" target=\"\">D.L.

Hundreds of cookbooks are published each year. Some are good. Others are e,xceptional. A few are essential. Samin Nosrat just published &ldquo;Salt Fat Acid Heat &mdash; Mastering the Elements of Good Cooking&rdquo; and I daresay this one is essential. Cookbooks are laden with recipes &mdash; with that information we should be able to make dishes turn out well, right? The efforts we put into transforming recipes into flavorful dishes can sometimes feel like a waste of time. Foods that looked wonderful on the page don&rsquo;t always turn out as we might have expected. It really helps if we actually understand how to cook. That&rsquo;s the fabulous thing about this book &mdash; it teaches readers about cooking, how to employ various techniques, and how to grasp that any subtle variations in technique can have significant impacts upon our end results. It is possible to learn how to cook great food. As a child, Nosrat enjoyed the Persian dishes her family prepared. While attending college she had a meal at what is considered to be the best restaurant in America, Chez Panisse. That experience changed her life. She applied for a job there. As she observed and participated in the cooking taking place, she had a revelation. In the introduction to her book she reveals her realization that &ldquo;anyone can cook anything and make it delicious.&rdquo; MORE BOOK NOOK: A dozen great reasons to discover this series She explains, &ldquo;there are only four basic factors that determine how good your food will taste: salt, which enhances flavor; fat, which amplifies flavor and makes appealing textures possible; acid, which brightens and balances; and heat, which ultimately determines the texture of the food.&rdquo; After we fully comprehend that salt, fat, acid and heat are &ldquo;the four cardinal directions of cooking,&rdquo; we are ready to transform recipes and/or products of our own imaginations into appetizing dishes. We can build the confidence to cook on the fly while using the best ingredients available at the time, to improvise, to experiment, to really savor our flavor adventures. She goes into depth in each section &mdash; we delve into the science of what she is doing. For example, we learn about &ldquo;the Maillard reaction, heat&rsquo;s most significant contribution to flavor.&rdquo; When we employ acids in cooking the Maillard reaction can produce sour flavors. When we are using heat it will create savory scents and new textures. &ldquo;Salt Fat Acid Heat &mdash; Mastering the Elements of Good Cooking&rdquo; contains an abundance of material written in an approachable manner while remaining informative. Oh, and it is also filled with tempting recipes. Now that I feel hopeful that I have absorbed her food science and techniques, I&rsquo;m ready to embark on culinary expeditions. First I&rsquo;ll try out her recipe for slow-roasted salmon. This book is bound to become an indispensable addition to cookbook shelves throughout America.

That time the radio host and ringmaster of the &ldquo;Infowars&rdquo; website said the government brought Ebola into the country to terrorize us? That time he said a Beyonce video was created to start a new civil war, that time he wished gang rape on Jennifer Lopez, those times he suggested the Oklahoma City bombing, the Sept. 11 attacks and the bombing of the Boston Marathon were &ldquo;false flag&rdquo; operations by the government against the people? It was all an act. His lawyer says he was just playing a character. You see, he&rsquo;s a &ldquo;performance artist.&rdquo; That claim, reported Sunday by the Austin American-Statesman, came in an Austin courtroom as Jones&rsquo; ex-wife, Kelly, seeks custody of their three children on the not-unreasonable grounds that a man who spews spittle for a living is not someone you want raising your kids. She says Jones is &ldquo;not a stable person.&rdquo; But lawyer Randall Wilhite argued that judging Jones by his on-air persona would be like judging Jack Nicholson by his performance as The Joker in &ldquo;Batman.&rdquo; In other words, like the Oscar-winning actor, Jones is just pretending to be a madman. You have to wonder how Edgar Welch feels about that. He&rsquo;s the North Carolina man who shot up a pizzeria in Washington, D.C., last year because he believed a tale spread by Jones and others that it was the headquarters of a child molestation ring run by Hillary Clinton. He faces the possibility of many years in prison when he is sentenced in June. You have to wonder how Leonard Pozner feels about it, too. He&rsquo;s been getting death threats and has been challenged to prove that his son Noah ever existed, all because Jones and others claimed the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, in which Noah and 25 others were killed, was a hoax. He faces the rest of his life without his child. Finally, you have to wonder how Donald Trump feels about it. The so-called president has professed admiration for Jones and has built his worldview, such as it is, around a Jones-like belief that a tangled skein of conspiracies explains virtually everything in life that refutes, frustrates or embarrasses him. We face four years of him steering the ship of state. As regards the lawyer&rsquo;s claim, there are two possible conclusions. One: he&rsquo;s telling the truth and Jones never believed the garbage he vomited. Or two: Jones is trying to hoax the court. Not that it matters which is true. Either way, Jones has hurt people and ruined lives. Either way, he has helped damage the country. We now live in the United States of Confusion, a nation of alternative realities and alternative facts where reasoned and informed political debate is all but impossible because too many of us prize ideology above factuality. A coterie of media charlatans eagerly caters to that intellectual flaccidity and Jones was loud among them, so there is a certain satisfaction in seeing him revealed as a hypocrite and fraud. But the feeling is fleeting. After all, given the gullibility of his followers, there is no reason to believe this will be the end of him &mdash; or what he represents. Jones fills a need. Frightened people seek easy ways to comprehend the big, bad world. Alternative facts and realities are among the easiest. And never mind the damage that is done, the ignorance that is fostered, the pain that is caused. Meantime the rest of us &mdash; dare we still say, &ldquo;most&rdquo; of us? &mdash; muddle through actual reality using actual facts to confront the big, bad world. It is not easy. But it sure beats the alternatives. -->\n<article class=\"story cm-channel-story cm-story \">\n\t    <div class=\"story-tease-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"story-title\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/news/opinion/opinion-turns-out-alex-jones-was-only-pretending-madman/upsnqXPzylC0067oqTFcaI/\" target=\"\">Opinion: Turns out Alex Jones was only pretending to be a madman </a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t        <p class=\"story-byline\">\n    \n\t    by\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nLeonard Pitts, <span class=\"story-source\">Miami Herald</span>\n\t</p>\n<div class=\"story-text cm-truncate\" style=\"word-wrap: break-word; visibility: visible;\"><div>So it turns out Alex Jones was only kidding.

After firefighters arrived, they used a ladder to help the woman climb to safety. Officials told FOX23 she was fortunate to walk away unharmed. &quot;I know the driver didn't intend for that to happen, but that's how fast accidents like this occur,&quot; said Broken Arrow Deputy Fire Chief James Suddath.

mesmerized her. That was five years ago and it&rsquo;s no different today. &ldquo;Her name is Sierra LaMar and she went missing relatively close to where I grew up in California,&rdquo; University of Dayton rower Rosario &ldquo;Rosie&rdquo; Perez said Friday afternoon. &ldquo;She was in high school &mdash; a kid about my age then &mdash; and she just disappeared. &ldquo;The first time I saw the missing girl poster our (high school) team was going to a lacrosse tournament in Gilroy. The poster was at the entrance to the complex and her story just really hit me. After that I followed the &lsquo;Find Sierra LaMar&rsquo; Facebook page and everything. It was just so sad. And she&rsquo;s still missing today. They have no idea what happened to her body.&rdquo; LaMar &mdash; a 15-year-old sophomore cheerleader at nearby Sobrato High School who soon became known as &ldquo;Everyone&rsquo;s Daughter&rdquo; &mdash; went missing on a March morning in 2012 as she headed to the bus stop to go to school. A few months later, a 21-year-old high school dropout was arrested and charged with her murder. He denies involvement and his lawyers have dragged the case out for years. The trial is going on right now. &ldquo;That story really moved her,&rdquo; Rosie&rsquo;s mom, Monica Perez Burnett, said the other day. &ldquo;The image of that girl really stayed with her. She was like &lsquo;Gosh, something needs to be done about these types of things.&rsquo; And that has prompted her to want to go into the type career she&rsquo;s pursuing right now. She wants to make a difference.&rdquo; Now a senior rower for the Flyers who is about to graduate with a double-major degree in criminal justice and psychology, Rosie Perez hopes to do just that. So does her roommate and best friend, Danielle Foust, also a graduating senior, a standout on the rowing team and a criminal justice major as well. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t have the typical college experience and I&rsquo;m thankful for that,&rdquo; said Foust, who could just as easily have been speaking for Perez. Both of the 22-year-olds are top students and college athletes and in their four years at UD, one or the other has done everything from don a bullet-proof vest for a U.S. Marshals operation here to help in the investigation of a West Side homicide with the Dayton police to be part of drug raids and federal probation visits. Perez and Foust, both of whom are headed into law enforcement careers after they graduate from UD in two weeks, already have been immersed in the field with a variety of hands-on internships during their college years. Foust &mdash; who has interned with the district attorney&rsquo;s office in Salt Lake City, Utah, Catholic Social Services and both the United States Probation Office and the U.S. Marshals Service in Dayton &mdash; has gone through a series of extensive applications and upon six months of academy training in Georgia and Maryland, is headed to a federal law enforcement position in Washington D.C. Perez, who has prepped with various parts of the Dayton Police Department and has passed some prelim tests, hopes to join the Dayton police force or another in Ohio in the fall. She has gotten some real on-the-job training, be it working next to Chief Richard Biehl or in the field with a cold-case detective she especially admires. Along the way she has ended up various police situations, including the investigation of a homicide last summer. &ldquo;It was my first dead body,&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;What affected me most was the state of the house and the little kids who were living there. &ldquo;A middle-aged guy was shot by his girlfriend and they had three young children &mdash; 6 and under &mdash; who were living in horrible conditions. It was really sad for them. Now their dad was gone and their mom was going to jail for his murder. &ldquo;The youngest kid had a mental disability and he was asleep on the couch the entire time. When he woke up, he was really confused by it all. &ldquo;What really hit me was the little girl. She was playing with My Little Pony. And at that time my youngest sister was obsessed by My Little Pony. &ldquo;They were probably the same age. I looked at that girl and thought she could have been my sister. Here they were, two little girls in love with the same thing, but their circumstances were so incredibly different. &ldquo;It just makes you want to do all you can for people in situations like that.&rdquo; Perez grew up mostly in East Palo Alto, California, which, she said, had serious crime and poverty issues when she was born in 1995. Three years earlier it had the highest homicide rate in the nation according to a report in The Stanford Daily. In recent years the crime numbers for the city &mdash; whose population is mainly Hispanic, but also has many African-Americans and Pacific Islanders &mdash; has subsided dramatically and there have been an influx of workers from nearby Google, Facebook and Amazon operations. &ldquo;When I was growing up there were drugs and gangs and drive-by shootings in our neighborhood, but I really knew nothing about that,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;My parents and my grandparents, who we lived with, were very protective and they raised us pretty well. We weren&rsquo;t involved in anything bad. &ldquo;I ended up at a private girls&rsquo; school because my mom taught music there. My direct family did really well actually. One of my cousins followed me here to Dayton, another graduated from Yale and another went to Harvard.&rdquo; When it came time to pick a college, she said she wanted to move away and looked at schools like Marquette and Creighton before choosing UD without ever setting foot on the campus. Her first day here was &ldquo;move-in day&rdquo; for freshmen. Foust came to UD by a bit of happenstance, as well. Growing up in Rives Junction, Michigan near Jackson, she looked at some in-state schools and then considered Bowling Green until someone suggested she look at UD if she was going to matriculate at an Ohio school. She said she &ldquo;fell in love with the campus&rdquo; and once here she heard about the rowing program, which recruits most of its athletes with what Coach Mike Wenker called its &ldquo;dorm storm.&rdquo; Members of the team canvas the dorms asking students if they&rsquo;d be interested in trying out for the (non-scholarship) rowing team. They also put up posters and pass out handbills and that invitation intrigued Foust, who had been a three-sport athlete &mdash; basketball, soccer, cross country &mdash; in high school. &ldquo;But I couldn&rsquo;t ever get her to go kayaking with me,&rdquo; laughed her mom, Kris Foust. The UD pitch struck a chord though, especially because prospects need not have rowed before. &ldquo;Rowing is a weird sport,&rdquo; Wenker said with a laugh. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of the only sports you can start as an 18-year-old and maybe end up on the national team.&rdquo; Case in point was former UD rower Bernadette Marten. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s the only rower in the (UD) Hall of Fame and after she graduated from college (Michigan), she ended up a world champion,&rdquo; Wenker said. Foust became one of the team captains this season and Perez had been an integral part in their eight-woman boat until she tore ligaments in her wrist a few weeks ago in the weight room. She&rsquo;s also a budding power lifter who recently won her first competition Along with representing the university in intercollegiate competition &mdash; the team competed in Pittsburgh on Saturday, is in Virginia today and the Atlantic 10 Championships are in New Jersey in two weeks &mdash; both women say the lessons and demands of the rowing team serve them well in other parts of their lives, including their law enforcement endeavors. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty demanding,&rdquo; Kris Foust said of her daughter&rsquo;s commitment to the sport. &ldquo;They get up or 4 or 5 in the morning to train (on the Great Miami River) and then they go to classes and then get together for another workout later.&rdquo; She said it has helped Danielle become really regimented and disciplined. But it&rsquo;s not for everyone, said Danielle: &ldquo;We started out with 25 girls freshman year and now we&rsquo;re graduating with five. You really have to be committed. You&rsquo;ve got to be able to work out every day and balance your time. You&rsquo;re going to class and a lot of the girls are working and interning while rowing, too. And through it all you have to enjoy what you&rsquo;re doing and that can be a very thin line.&rdquo; The lessons, though, are invaluable, she said: &ldquo;I work out every day with a group of girls who have the same goals as me, the same passion as me. And that translates now to (law enforcement) where we work together &hellip; to better the community.&rdquo; Perez sees a correlation of what happens in the boat to what happens in life: &ldquo;With rowing, whatever you do, big or small, is going to affect every single person in the boat. Like if you are early or late (with your stroke) or your hand handle height is a little low or high, you&rsquo;re gonna affect the next person, good or bad. And all that can be implemented into daily life. &ldquo;Everything you do &mdash; a kind gesture or something not so nice &mdash; is going to affect someone else.&rdquo; Kris Foust graduated from Michigan State with a criminal justice degree and before raising her family with husband Dan, she worked for the Michigan Supreme Court. When Danielle took up the same course of study, Kris said she suggested her daughter &ldquo;do several internships to find out what you like. See if you want to go in enforcement or social work or administration.&rdquo; Danielle did that and said she settled on enforcement as a way you might be able to bring about &ldquo;a positive experience in someone else&rsquo;s life.&rdquo; Rosie agreed and said she especially has her old neighborhood in mind: &ldquo;Seeing things that happened there and the way some of the younger generation views the police made me want to do this all the more for those people in the rough environment. I think with my background &mdash; I&rsquo;m Hispanic &mdash; I can connect two worlds together.&rdquo; Her mom &mdash; who has remarried, moved to North Carolina and now has eight kids total, including two sets of twins, ages 6 and 3 &mdash; said she takes special pride in her oldest daughter. She said the other day someone from UD contacted her to put together some thoughts on Rosie for an upcoming rowing banquet. &ldquo;The words that came to mind were strength &mdash; she is extremely strong physically and mentally &mdash; and commitment. She&rsquo;s a person of her word. People believe her. They trust her. When she says something, when she starts something, she sticks with it. &ldquo;I admire her for that. I tend to start something and then easily step out of it when it gets boring. Then I move on to the next thing. Not her. She doesn&rsquo;t waver.&rdquo; Kris had similar praise for her daughter: &ldquo;Danielle is the oldest of our four kids. She&rsquo;s got a younger sister at Bowling Green, a brother at Grand Valley (State) and another who&rsquo;s a junior in high school. She&rsquo;s been a great leader for them. She&rsquo;s shown you need to put yourself out there &mdash; sometimes in an uncomfortable situation &mdash; and stand on what you believe.

Students from the elementary school up to the high school took Friday to serve the community. Depending on the student&rsquo;s age, they tackled tasks like planting flowers around the school, visiting a local nursing home, washing cars, painting lockers, picking up trash and other activities that made St. Paris and the surrounding area a better place than how they found it. Middle school student Max Barela said the day was fun and taught him and his classmates a lot. &ldquo;We are building a flower garden for our school,&rdquo; he said of the task he was assigned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty cool, it&rsquo;s a good way to get to know everybody and do some teamwork.&rdquo; &ldquo;The community service is also great,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It really helps the kids understand how helpful you can really be if you put some time and effort into this stuff.&rdquo; School staff members said they were proud of students who worked hard throughout the day to help their community. Graham Director of Operations Don Burley said the students embraced the day. &ldquo;There were core teams of student leaders that planned this day,&rdquo; Burley said. &ldquo;They set up all the events and made the contacts. They coordinated with teachers and staff on who will be overseeing the different projects and those student leaders created an environment of service and selflessness.&rdquo; The students are a great example for others, he said. Staff member Emily Smith said the event is part of the school&rsquo;s strategic plan to get students involved in the community and doing community service. &ldquo;Graham is very involved in providing service opportunities for our students,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve worked for several months now to make the events today possible.&rdquo; Smith coordinated the event and said it was great to work with such determined students. Multiple companies from the area donated money, items and time to make service day a success. Burley said he expects the service day to become a tradition at the school district. &ldquo;This has been a great first attempt and this is something that Graham is going to do every year,&rdquo; Burley said. &ldquo;We want to create great citizens for our community. We are very proud of our students.&rdquo; -->\n<article class=\"story cm-channel-story cm-story cm-image\">\n\t    <a href=\"/news/local-education/graham-students-give-back-the-community/sWT6FqDX3QA9WnNzeHPsCI/\" class=\"story-photo-link\" target=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"/rf/image/Pub/p8/WHIO/2017/04/21/Videos/4042611.vpx\" title=\"Graham students give back to the community \" alt=\"Graham students give back to the community \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"story-tease-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"story-title\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/news/local-education/graham-students-give-back-the-community/sWT6FqDX3QA9WnNzeHPsCI/\" target=\"\">Graham students give back to the community </a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t        <p class=\"story-byline\">\n    \n\t    by\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nParker Perry</p>\n<div class=\"story-text cm-truncate\" style=\"word-wrap: break-word; visibility: visible;\"><div>Graham Local Schools held the district’s first service day Friday, aiming to teach students the value of helping others in their community.

The Wayne High School senior is strong, has sprinter speed and a can-do attitude, all things needed to stick a pole in the ground and launch yourself skyward upside down. She also has something else going for her this spring. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s super mental and me, I&rsquo;m also a super mental person,&rdquo; Graysen explained after soaring a meet-best 12 feet in the 67th Dayton Edwin C. Moses Relays at Welcome Stadium on Friday. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learned you just have to adapt to the situation you&rsquo;re in. That&rsquo;s my motto for the season, adapt. I&rsquo;m struggling but I&rsquo;m getting through the season with it. We&rsquo;re getting there.&rdquo; Dunbar needed to be six points better than Thomas Worthington in the meet&rsquo;s final event, the 4x400-meter relay, to win the boys championship. The Wolverines placed second in the event (3:29.77) and Worthington was fifth. That was a four-point spread, which enabled Worthington to win the boys team title, 63-62 over Dunbar. Trotwood-Madison (59.5) was third, followed by Wayne (56) and Northmont (50.5). Troy (80.5) won the girls team title, beating runner-up Worthington (63.5), Lima Senior (62), Centerville (61) and Northmont (59.5). Simmons is among another outstanding bunch of boys and girls vaulters this spring. Vandalia-Butler freshman Dalton Shepler cleared 14 feet to lead the boys individuals. All the events were running relays and two-man field event totals. &ldquo;It means a lot because I&rsquo;ve been struggling the past few meets getting over 12 and getting new sticks,&rdquo; said Simmons, who missed three times in what would have been an outdoor personal best of 12-6. &ldquo;I finally hit my big pole and I blew through my last jump. Now, we&rsquo;re going on my next stick. I&rsquo;m finally over 12 (feet) and I&rsquo;m super excited.&rdquo; Simmons said vaulters are a unique group who often share the same advice from coaches and train together in the offseason. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s something in the water,&rdquo; said Simmons, who hopes to continue vaulting at Eastern Michigan University. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all friends. The vaulters are one big family. That&rsquo;s what I love about it.&rdquo; &bull; The meet also featured a unique Swedish Sprint Medley Relay: The opening leg was a 100, followed in order by a 200, 300 and 400. Northmont (1:58.31) anchor Xavier Marabell overtook Dunbar on his anchor leg to win. Lima Senior (2:20.25) beat runner-up Troy by more than four seconds to take the girls race. &bull; Other notable winning performances were Centerville high jumper Jermea Lyle (5-2) and Northmont&rsquo;s Christian Wilson (6-3), Dunbar long jumper Keyshawn Jones (22-0.50) and the Trowood-Madison boys 4x800 relay (1:30.03). &bull; The Roosevelt Relays will return to Welcome Stadium on May 5-6. The Dayton City League meet also is at Welcome on May 9. -->\n<article class=\"story cm-channel-story cm-story cm-image\">\n\t    <a href=\"/sports/vaulting-mental-thing-for-wayne-simmons/zDQvUyqOQnvenBnrheX8IO/\" class=\"story-photo-link\" target=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"/rf/image/Pub/p8/WHIO/2017/04/22/Videos/4043066.vpx\" title=\"Vaulting: It’s a mental thing for Wayne’s Simmons \" alt=\"Vaulting: It’s a mental thing for Wayne’s Simmons \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"story-tease-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"story-title\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/sports/vaulting-mental-thing-for-wayne-simmons/zDQvUyqOQnvenBnrheX8IO/\" target=\"\">Vaulting: It’s a mental thing for Wayne’s Simmons </a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t        <p class=\"story-byline\">\n    \n\t    by\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nMarc Pendleton</p>\n<div class=\"story-text cm-truncate\" style=\"word-wrap: break-word; visibility: visible;\"><div>Graysen Simmons has all the physical qualities of being a great vaulter.

Fire Department. &ldquo;The homeowner had woke up, smelled some smoke and went out and looked and saw that the garage was fully involved and called us out here,&rdquo; she said. Earlier it was reported that no one was home. There were no injuries, Brewer said. &ldquo;His garage is going to be a total loss,&rdquo; the captain said. The estimated damage is not available because crews also need to assess the value of the two vehicles that were inside, she said. The cause of the fire remains under investigation. &ldquo;There was some minor exterior damage to the house,&rdquo; but none to the inside of the home that&nbsp;was close to the garage, Brewer said. Bellbrook firefighters also responded to the scene. Flames are still showing from the detached garage, which Beavercreek Twp.&nbsp; A car could be seen inside the burning garage as firefighters sprayed water to contain the fire and protect the nearby house, which did sustain minor damage, crews said. No one was home at the time of the fire, according to a firefighter on scene. We are on scene and are working to find what fire officials believe may have caused the fire, and the estimated damage. A detached garage crews said was very close to a house on North Fairfield Road, in the area of Jonathon Drive, was heavily damaged by fire.&nbsp; Crews said they are going &quot;defensive&quot; in fighting the fire in the 800 block of North Fairfield Road. That means the structure will be allowed to burn and crews will keep the flames from spreading.&nbsp; Crews were dispatched about 10:20 p.m. on a report of a structure fire. There are no reports of any injuries, but a medic has been dispatched as well.&nbsp; We have a crew on the way. We will update this developing report.&nbsp; -->\n<article class=\"story cm-channel-story cm-story cm-image\">\n\t    <a href=\"/news/local/fire-beavercreek-engulfs-detached-garage-damages-house/XNTP4dabIP97CuZYPFizrO/\" class=\"story-photo-link\" target=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"/rf/image/Pub/p8/WHIO/2017/04/22/Videos/4043019.vpx\" title=\"Fire in Beavercreek engulfs detached garage, damages house \" alt=\"Fire in Beavercreek engulfs detached garage, damages house \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"story-tease-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"story-title\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/news/local/fire-beavercreek-engulfs-detached-garage-damages-house/XNTP4dabIP97CuZYPFizrO/\" target=\"\">Fire in Beavercreek engulfs detached garage, damages house </a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t        <p class=\"story-byline\">\n    \n\t    by\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t  \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBreaking News Staff</p>\n<div class=\"story-text cm-truncate\" style=\"word-wrap: break-word; visibility: visible;\"><div>A detached garage was engulfed tonight with flames through the roof when crews arrived, said Capt.

Powell confirmed on Friday that he had retained the position. Powell was among multiple Dunbar coaches and DPS administrators who were involved in a series of Week 10 events in a regular-season finale against Belmont at Welcome Stadium last season. A charge of deliberately trying to &ldquo;throw a game&rdquo; ultimately led to one of the harshest Ohio High School Athletic Association rulings in its history: a three-year probation for all Dayton Public Schools boys and girls athletic teams and $10,000 fine. &ldquo;This is what I wanted,&rdquo; Powell said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m back and we can get things moving forward. We&rsquo;ve got a lot to prove next season.&rdquo; See Sunday&rsquo;s Dayton Daily News and DaytonDailyNews.com for a story. &ndash; Marc Pendleton, Staff -->\n<article class=\"story cm-channel-story cm-story cm-image\">\n\t    <a href=\"/sports/powell-returns-dunbar-football-coach-following-allegations-thrown-game/EDpD4sKBAJYNTLQWbaMcII/\" class=\"story-photo-link\" target=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"/rf/image/Pub/p8/WHIO/2017/04/20/Videos/4039964.vpx\" title=\"Powell returns as Dunbar football coach following allegations of thrown game \" alt=\"Powell returns as Dunbar football coach following allegations of thrown game \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"story-tease-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"story-title\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/sports/powell-returns-dunbar-football-coach-following-allegations-thrown-game/EDpD4sKBAJYNTLQWbaMcII/\" target=\"\">Powell returns as Dunbar football coach following allegations of thrown game </a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t        <p class=\"story-byline\">\n    \n\t    by\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nMarc Pendleton</p>\n<div class=\"story-text cm-truncate\" style=\"word-wrap: break-word; visibility: visible;\"><div>Darran Powell has been renewed as the Dunbar High School football coach.

He believes the Cougars are starting to come together as they&rsquo;ve won five of their last six games, including Friday&rsquo;s 13-1, six-inning overpowering of host Talawanda. &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ve been playing at about 70 percent,&rdquo; said Asher, who briefly retired after his 16th season at the helm last year, then opted to return in 2017. &ldquo;We had a good gap in the team earlier in the year. Once we close the gap all the way &mdash; and it will happen &mdash; then I&rsquo;ll feel really good about this team.&rdquo; Junior pitcher Sam Davis agreed that team chemistry was an issue when the season began. &ldquo;Usually this team is really close and like sisters, but we didn&rsquo;t really hang out at the beginning of the season,&rdquo; Davis said. &ldquo;Then when we were not doing so hot, we did a team bonding and started picking each other up and started winning. I think we&rsquo;re finally starting to jell.&rdquo; &ldquo;I think it was just different ages,&rdquo; said Asher, noting that he has five seniors and a starting lineup that includes three freshmen. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had chemistry problems before where the girls just weren&rsquo;t nice to each other. These girls aren&rsquo;t mean to each other. They just need to come together a little more.&rdquo; Davis led the way against Talawanda, tossing a four-hitter with seven strikeouts while going 4-for-5 with three RBIs. Edgewood is 8-4 overall and 4-1 in the Southwest Ohio Conference, and all four of the Cougars&rsquo; defeats have come by one run. Little Miami (7-2) is the only two-loss squad in SWOC play. &ldquo;We could easily be undefeated right now, but we&rsquo;ve had some bad breaks here and there,&rdquo; Asher said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for us to get on a roll like we did last year.&rdquo; The Braves (5-10, 2-5) didn&rsquo;t challenge Edgewood. The hosts avoided the shutout when Lauren Baker, who had two hits, delivered a two-out RBI single in the sixth. Talawanda committed eight errors along the way, seven in the last three innings. &ldquo;They brought their &lsquo;A&rsquo; game and we didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Braves coach Stephanie Guenther said. &ldquo;I know at one point Sam Davis had six strikeouts in nine batters. She&rsquo;s a good pitcher, but we need to at least be swinging the bat. We just looked panicky on defense, and it went downhill really quick.&rdquo; Madison Asher had three hits and three RBIs for the Cougars, and Jenna Evans added two hits and an RBI. Ally Williams, Hailey Jackson and Michaela Finkbine drove in a run apiece. Davis issued no walks and pushed her record to 8-3. She&rsquo;s on the mend from a groin injury. &ldquo;The good thing is we kind of jumped on them in the first inning with two runs,&rdquo; Wayne Asher said. &ldquo;With Sammi pitching, that&rsquo;s a pretty good start.&rdquo; He said Davis was one of several EHS players that convinced him to coach this year. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known her since she&rsquo;s been little,&rdquo; Asher said. &ldquo;When your star pitcher looks you in the eye and asks you to come back, you don&rsquo;t want to let her down. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really ready to retire, but it&rsquo;s amazing when you retire how many people it affects. My age is telling me to get out and my heart&rsquo;s wanting to stay with it. It&rsquo;s fun coaching these girls. We&rsquo;ve got a great group this year.&rdquo; Talawanda has already earned as many wins as it did last year in Guenther&rsquo;s first season as head coach. The Braves were 5-18 overall and 3-9 in the SWOC in 2016. Friday&rsquo;s performance aside, Guenther said the program is improving. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going to win the conference in one year, but we can have those aspirations and strive for it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We have six seniors, but we also have a lot of new kids on the team. One of our goals was to go .500 this year, and we want to win more games in the conference. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a worst-case scenario. Our goals are not out of reach by any means, and I think our team has the ability to come back and make some noise. We&rsquo;ve been working a lot with the youth program. We&rsquo;re optimistic about the future.&rdquo; Both teams are scheduled for doubleheaders Saturday. Talawanda will be on the road to face Beavercreek, while the Cougars host Madison.

Phillip Ervin doesn&rsquo;t mind the standard set by his fellow outfielder, who was optioned to Triple-A Louisville on Sunday. Ervin may get a chance to match or surpass it after being recalled from Louisville on Friday. &ldquo;I was very happy for Winker to get his first hit,&rdquo; Ervin said before Friday&rsquo;s game against the Chicago Cubs. &ldquo;That motivated me. I think it&rsquo;s great.&rdquo; The 5-foot-10, 207-pound Ervin was called up to fill the 25-man roster slot left open when Cincinnati placed left-handed pitcher Tony Cingrani on the 10-day disabled list with a strained right oblique. The right-handed batter, the Reds&rsquo; top pick and the 27th overall selection in the June 2013 draft, was hitting .286 with three doubles, three home runs, a team-high 11 runs batted in and two stolen bases in 14 games with Louisville. Manager Bryan Price expected to use Ervin the same way he deployed Winker, who also was recalled on a Friday and replaced a pitcher on the roster. &ldquo;This is a good way for him to break the ice and get acclimated,&rdquo; Price said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be in more of a bench role. This will be a valuable experience for him. I&rsquo;m sure there are a lot of things he&rsquo;d like to get out of the way. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been swinging the bat well. He&rsquo;s a good basestealer. He&rsquo;s always run the bases well. The quality of his at-bats has improved. He&rsquo;s shortened his swing. I talked to (Louisville manager) Delino DeShields and got some positive reviews. I&rsquo;m looking forward to seeing him play.&rdquo; Ervin, 24, seemed to be a bit overwhelmed by the development. &ldquo;It meant a lot,&rdquo; the Alabama native said. &ldquo;I was kind of shocked. I didn&rsquo;t know how to act. I was like, &lsquo;Is this really happening?&rsquo; The emotions kind of all built up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not thinking about it,&rdquo; he added about his role. &ldquo;I just know that I&rsquo;m here until they tell me I&rsquo;m not. I&rsquo;m just going to enjoy it.&rdquo; Short stay: Price is hoping Cingrani&rsquo;s stay on the disabled list doesn&rsquo;t go too far beyond 10 days. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re hoping he&rsquo;ll be ready when the 10 days are up or close to it,&rdquo; Price said. &ldquo;I talked to Tony yesterday and, if it&rsquo;s just the 10 days, he&rsquo;ll still probably need at least one rehab outing, just to be sure.&rdquo; Progress reports: Rookie right-hander Rookie Davis threw what Price described as a &ldquo;good, aggressive bullpen&rdquo; on Friday as he tries to come back from the bruised right forearm &mdash; the result of being hit by a pitch &mdash; that sent him to the disabled list April 12. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to wait to see how he comes out of it,&rdquo; Price said. Right-hander Nefi Ogando, sidelined in spring training with a right thumb injury, threw a bullpen on Thursday and is close to being ready to face hitters, Price said. Right-hander Homer Bailey, still trying to come back from surgeries on his elbow and forearm that have cost him most of the past two seasons, continues to throw on flat ground. The target date for him to climb on to a mound is late April or early May, Price said. Next: Left-hander Cody Reed is scheduled to make his first 2017 start on Saturday at 1:10 p.m. in the second game of the three-game series against the defending World Series-champion Cubs. Right-hander Jake Arrieta, for whom Friday was the one-year anniversary of his no-hitter against the Reds at Great American Ball Park, is Chicago&rsquo;s projected starter. -->\n<article class=\"story cm-channel-story cm-story cm-image\">\n\t    <a href=\"/sports/ervin-reds-callup-just-going-enjoy/9LCxm3cjGUoCFY4FF1wKeJ/\" class=\"story-photo-link\" target=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"/rf/image_inline/Pub/p8/DaytonDailyNews/2017/04/22/Images/newsEngin.18485561_072914-dragons-2.jpg\" title=\"Ervin on Reds callup: ‘I’m just going to enjoy it’ \" alt=\"Ervin on Reds callup: ‘I’m just going to enjoy it’ \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"story-tease-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"story-title\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/sports/ervin-reds-callup-just-going-enjoy/9LCxm3cjGUoCFY4FF1wKeJ/\" target=\"\">Ervin on Reds callup: ‘I’m just going to enjoy it’ </a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t        <p class=\"story-byline\">\n    \n\t    by\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nMark Schmetzer, <span class=\"story-source\">Contributing Writer</span>\n\t</p>\n<div class=\"story-text cm-truncate\" style=\"word-wrap: break-word; visibility: visible;\"><div>Last weekend, Jesse Winker made his major-league debut with the Cincinnati Reds and, on Saturday in his second career at-bat, delivered a pinch-hit, go-ahead two-run double that led to a 7-5 win over the Milwaukee Brewers.

Nix scattered five hits and gave up two unearned runs but the Falcons dropped a 2-1 decision to Cincinnati McNicholas in a home game that took 75 minutes to complete. Fenwick had beaten the Rockets 9-5 on the road Wednesday. &ldquo;Nix had a heck of a game,&rdquo; Stratton said. &ldquo;They put some balls in play, but I don&rsquo;t think they ever really figured him out. I think he threw well enough to get a win. We just didn&rsquo;t support him. We played great defense but had a couple mental mistakes. It was an all-around good ballgame, but kudos to them.&rdquo; Fenwick (9-5, 4-4 Greater Catholic League Coed North Division) jumped on the board first, taking a 1-0 lead in the bottom of the second inning on Brad Davenport&rsquo;s one-out double that brought Jake Schaefer in from first base. The next two batters flied out, though, leaving Davenport stranded in scoring position. McNicholas (8-7, 5-2 GCLC Central) took advantage of some Fenwick mistakes to gain the lead in the fourth, and that would decide the game. Rockets second baseman Michael Lang reached on an error to lead off and Brian Ford followed with a single. Both runners advanced to scoring position on a passed ball before Nix coaxed a strikeout, and Zach Arnold and Joey Miller drove them in on a single and sacrifice fly, respectively. &ldquo;We preach to our kids about being smart, moving runners and doing the little things,&rdquo; McNicholas coach John Christmann said. &ldquo;Both teams played very well. It was just that we got two runs and they got one. &ldquo;The first game we played the other day wasn&rsquo;t a very good game. Every time we play these guys, it&rsquo;s usually a really good game, so I expect a one-run game. It&rsquo;s awesome to get the one-run win.&rdquo; Nix (2-1) faced one batter over the minimum over the final three frames and finished with six strikeouts. Meanwhile, the Falcons couldn&rsquo;t get the timely hits they needed to come back. They left two runners on base in the fifth inning and got their lone base runners in the sixth and seventh innings with two outs, only to have the next batter ground out both times. Ford (2-2), the Rockets pitcher, surrendered just four hits and had three walks and two strikeouts. &ldquo;They had a nice inning where they moved runners over, did what they had to do to get them in, sacrificed a fly &mdash; that&rsquo;s good baseball,&rdquo; Stratton said. &ldquo;They did what they had to do, but we struggled with that. We struggled moving guys around, getting guys on and we struggled adjusting to their pitcher. He had some nice stuff.&rdquo; Fenwick looks to bounce back against a strong Kings squad Saturday in the Reds Futures High School Showcase at P&G Cincinnati MLB Youth Academy. First pitch is set for 2 p.m. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a tough league loss, a close game, so I told the guys not to hang their heads because we have Kings tomorrow, and I know they are a highly-ranked Division I team,&rdquo; Stratton said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had some success against big Division I teams already this year, so it&rsquo;s going to be a big day tomorrow.&rdquo; McNicholas hosts Badin on Monday.

The twist? The scammers are using the names of actual deputies to solicit money from unsuspecting victims.&nbsp; &quot;It's sickening because a lot of times they're focusing on the elderly,&quot; said Chief Deputy Rob Streck.&nbsp; He has seen plenty of scams during his time at the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office. In the latest attempt, a caller claiming to be with the sheriff's office tells you that they either have a warrant for your arrest or that you owe money for skipping jury duty.&nbsp; They tell residents &quot;that they need to come downtown and put their credit card into a kiosk or go to Kroger and get a Kroger card and put money on, on this kind of card,&quot; he said.&nbsp; It's a scam that scares people into doing the wrong thing.&nbsp; Not only do the scammers say they work at the sheriff's office, they use the names of actual employees to sound more official to possible victims.&nbsp; &quot;The scam artists are smart enough to say, 'hey in this technology world somebody may be smart enough to Google somebody's name.' If they Google Rob Streck, one of the first things that pop up is a link to the sheriff's office website,&rdquo; the chief deputy said. Anyone who gets a scam call is urged to immediately hang up and call the sheriff's office to report it. The sheriff's office would never tell a person to buy a gift card to settle a debt. -->\n<article class=\"story cm-channel-story cm-story cm-image\">\n\t    <a href=\"/news/crime--law/mont-sheriff-warns-old-scam-with-new-twist/bv7RLhAbhwo8XyQuqCXMDL/\" class=\"story-photo-link\" target=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"/rf/image/Pub/p8/WHIO/2017/04/22/Videos/4043065.vpx\" title=\"Mont.

Water sample results showed acceptable levels of chlorine residue. One of the 32 restaurants or business serving food that were directly notified of the boil alert by the city was TJ Chumps on East Linden Avenue, where business dropped off after the advisory was first issued, said Managing Partner Mike Leigh. &ldquo;It really causes some difficulty in the operations of the business,&rdquo; he said. FIRST REPORT: Miamisburg issues water boil advisory The level of chlorine in samples at the city&rsquo;s water treatment plant Thursday morning fell below Ohio EPA recommended levels because of a mechanical failure, prompting a boil advisory for about 1,900 Miamisburg water customers, many of them businesses, said city Public Works Director Valerie Griffin. The advisory area included about one-third of land in the city, Griffin said, and the mechanical failure is &ldquo;not associated with the construction&rdquo; of the city&rsquo;s $69 million water and sewer master plan. Those upgrades are being paid for by annual rate hikes that have caused customer criticism in recent months. At TJ Chumps, the boil advisory &ldquo;absolutely&rdquo; had some impact on the 10 to 15 percent drop Leigh estimated the restaurant witnessed since it was issued. With the city&rsquo;s &ldquo;antiquated&rdquo; infrastructure, Leigh said the water issues have occurred frequently enough for the restaurant to issue guidelines for operational changes, such as wash room procedures or switching from dispensed to bottled drinks. RELATED: Miamisburg customers question water bills On South Main Street, Mz. Pickles Sandwich Shop owner Carol Brassington said the boil advisory caused frustration, inconveniences and precautions. &ldquo;Even just to do the dishes&hellip;. you can&rsquo;t rinse the dishes in contaminated water so you still have to use bottled water to do dishes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It just makes things go so much slower and it&rsquo;s more difficult.&rdquo; More than 850 gallons of bottled water were distributed Thursday and Friday, Griffin said, as Sam&rsquo;s Club, Costco and the Ohio EPA assisted. The mechanical failure occurred overnight Wednesday or early Thursday morning and wasn&rsquo;t detected at the water treatment plant until about 7 a.m. Thursday. &ldquo;You can manually switch, but it&rsquo;s set up on automation and it didn&rsquo;t switch over,&rdquo; Griffin said. &ldquo;So our staff was able to do it manually&hellip;..unfortunately, some of that infrastructure is getting old and doesn&rsquo;t work as it&rsquo;s designed.&rdquo; &ldquo;As part of the water and sewer master plan, we will have a better alarm system and better communications put it at the plant. So hopefully it will create some redundancies and we won&rsquo;t have surprises like this,&rdquo; she said. The five-year water and sewer upgrades are designed to modernize Miamisburg&rsquo;s water and sewer system. The rate hikes they are being financed with have been a source of contention with many customers in recent months &ndash; as have the accuracy of the bills received from the city. Facebook posts by Miamisburg customers Thursday and Friday reflected city water issues remain a sore spot. &ldquo;This is unfortunately a byproduct of running a utility and providing water to your customers. Sometimes failures happen,&rdquo; Griffin said. &ldquo;Failures happen in any system, and we apologize for the inconvenience.&rdquo; -->\n<article class=\"story cm-channel-story cm-story cm-image\">\n\t    <a href=\"/news/miamisburg-businesses-feel-effects-water-advisory/5XBdyNYSrypvguW6Brg5HK/\" class=\"story-photo-link\" target=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"/rf/image_inline/Pub/p8/MyDaytonDailyNews/2017/04/21/Images/newsEngin.18480743_042017msb-water-boil.jpg\" title=\"Miamisburg businesses feel effects of water advisory \" alt=\"Miamisburg businesses feel effects of water advisory \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"story-tease-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"story-title\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/news/miamisburg-businesses-feel-effects-water-advisory/5XBdyNYSrypvguW6Brg5HK/\" target=\"\">Miamisburg businesses feel effects of water advisory </a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t        <p class=\"story-byline\">\n    \n\t    by\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t   \n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t Nick Blizzard , Natalie Jovonovich , <span class=\"story-source\">Staff Writer</span>\n\t</p>\n<div class=\"story-text cm-truncate\" style=\"word-wrap: break-word; visibility: visible;\"><div>A Miamisburg boil water advisory affecting about 25 percent of the city customers — including many businesses in the downtown area – was lifted Friday evening.

News of the killings a year ago today caught the eye of the nation for a moment. But as the cameras, satellite trucks and reporters left, what remained was a family in pain and a $10,000 reward for the tip to end their nightmare. The video &mdash; announced moments before its release by Attorney General Mike DeWine on WHIO Radio&rsquo;s Miami Valley Morning News &mdash; is a plea from the family for answers and more donations to the Crime Stoppers reward. For nearly 30 minutes, Rhoden and Grebing describe their loss in what DeWine called &ldquo;gut-wrenching&rdquo; detail. &ldquo;Please, please, please come forward,&rdquo; Grebing says with increasing emotion, crackling the audio. Between sobs, she expresses comfort in knowing her lost family members would make the same plea for them had fate cast a different lot. She professes hope in knowing some day &ldquo;the case will be cracked and we will have answers.&rdquo; &ldquo;Please end this nightmare we&rsquo;ve been living,&rdquo; she says. The Rhodens &mdash; Christopher Sr., 40, Christopher Jr., 16, Dana, 37, Gary, 38, Hanna, 19, Kenneth, 44, and 20-year-old Frankie &mdash; died April 22, 2016, with Frankie&rsquo;s fiancee, Hannah Gilley, 20, in four homes across Pike County. DeWine told WHIO&rsquo;s Larry Hansgen it is &ldquo;hard to tell&rdquo; if would-be tipsters are withholding information more due to fear of prosecution or retaliation for speaking out. But he doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;think there&rsquo;s any doubt &hellip; there are people who know things they are simply not telling us.&rdquo; &ldquo;Anyone who has information and is afraid to give it to us because it might implicate them in some growing of marijuana or some sort of involvement in drugs, we want to assure them our focus is not on that,&rdquo; DeWine said. &ldquo;Our focus is on eight human beings who have been killed.&rdquo; But still, Pike County Sheriff Charles Reader said the fear of becoming another victim exists. &ldquo;The fear of retaliation from whoever these killers are, that&rsquo;s real,&rdquo; he said. Anyone with information on the murders is asked to call the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation, 1-855-BCI-OHIO (224-6446) or the Pike County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office at 740-947-2111. To make a donation to the reward fund, write a check to Southern Ohio Crime Stoppers. In the memo line, indicate the donation is for the Rhoden murders. Checks can be mailed to Deputy Dave Weber, c/o: Ross County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office, 28 North Paint St., Chillicothe, Ohio 45601. -->\n<article class=\"story cm-channel-story cm-story cm-image\">\n\t    <a href=\"/news/crime--law/pike-county-plea-end-this-nightmare-rhoden-family-survivors-say/IUaf9vLa2Nz5mVqHAxedXK/\" class=\"story-photo-link\" target=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"/rf/image_inline/Pub/p8/DaytonDailyNews/2017/04/21/Images/newsEngin.18480344_Geneva-Rhoden-Dispatch.jpg\" title=\"Pike County plea: ‘End this nightmare,’ Rhoden family survivors say \" alt=\"Pike County plea: ‘End this nightmare,’ Rhoden family survivors say \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"story-tease-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"story-title\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/news/crime--law/pike-county-plea-end-this-nightmare-rhoden-family-survivors-say/IUaf9vLa2Nz5mVqHAxedXK/\" target=\"\">Pike County plea: ‘End this nightmare,’ Rhoden family survivors say </a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t        <p class=\"story-byline\">\n    \n\t    by\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nWill Garbe</p>\n<div class=\"story-text cm-truncate\" style=\"word-wrap: break-word; visibility: visible;\"><div>Geneva Rhoden spent a year waking up, losing sleep and shedding more tears than she cares to count. “I would like to say from a mother’s heart, that I hurt so bad inside from the day that I found out,” Rhoden said about the methodical executions of her sons Christopher Sr. and Kenneth, her grandchildren and grandson’s fiancee. “I think about it day and night.” Rhoden...</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</article>\n\n\t\t            \n\t\t        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n<!-- Rendering article, 94, false -->\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n\t\t        \n\t\t            \n\t\t            \n\t\t                \n\t\t                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t                <!-- DEBUGGER: teasibleProperties.tag CUSTOM TEASE check -->\n        <!-- rootContainerSectionId: / -->\n        <!-- rootContainerPrimaryCategory: /Online/Home -->\n        <!-- object: PortalWebObjectWrapper [+      1219#] /Pub/p8/DaytonDailyNews/2017/04/21/Stories/newsEngin.18485543.xml [ConcreteProxyImpl:EOM::CompoundStory, 2.0.3104435359] -->\n        <!-- cacheScope: ContextMap[_rootContainerContextMap:ContextMap[primaryCategory:/Online/Home, sectionId:/]] -->\n        <!-- cacheScope type: class com.eidosmedia.portal.render.ctx.ContextMap -->\n        <!-- noRootContainer:  -->\n    \n \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n                        \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     \n\n\n        \n            \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n\n\t            \n\t               \n\t                \n\t                \n\t                \n\t                    \n\t                    \n\t                \n\t                    \n\t                    \n\t                \n\t                    \n\t                    \n\t                \n\t                    \n\t                    \n\t                \n\t                    \n\t                    \n\t                \n\t                    \n\t                    \n\t                \n\t                    \n\t                    \n\t                \n\t                    \n\t                    \n\t                \n\t                    \n\t                    \n\t                \n\t                    \n\t                    \n\t                \n\t                    \n\t                    \n\t                \n\t                    \n\t                    \n\t                \n\t                    \n\t                    \n\t                \n\t                    \n\t                    \n\t                \n\t                \n\t                \n\t            \n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n\t\t    \n        \n        \n    \n<!-- map content:  Kyle Schwarber isn&rsquo;t too concerned about being one of the few Middletown products &mdash; perhaps only two &mdash; to have accomplished what he did last season. The best available research suggests that only Schwarber and Jerry Lucas have played on teams that won world championships in major sports. Lucas was a member of the 1972-1973 New York Knicks who won the NBA championship. Schwarber, of course, recovered from two torn ligaments in his left knee in time to hit .412 with a double, two runs batted in and three walks last fall for the Chicago Cubs team that ended its 108-year drought by winning the World Series in a seven-game thriller against the Cleveland Indians. The catcher-turned-outfielder remains too thrilled about the accomplishment to worry about where he fits into Middletown lore. He continues to feel simply lucky to have been able to take part. &ldquo;Being a competitor, that&rsquo;s what you dream about,&rdquo; Schwarber, 24, said Friday in the Great American Ball Park visitors&rsquo; clubhouse before the opener of Chicago&rsquo;s three-game series against the Reds. &ldquo;Your ultimate goal is to win the championship. For me to be on a team that, No. 1, got there and then to win it and have it happen at a young age &mdash; the organization and the players get all the credit just for letting me come on board and be able to contribute.&rdquo; Schwarber, a 2011 Middletown High School graduate, returned to Cincinnati as the Cubs&rsquo; regular left fielder and leadoff hitter. The left-hander was hitting .232 with three home runs and eight RBIs while having played in all 15 games for 8-7 Chicago. He had a .500 (7-for-14) on-base percentage leading off and drew a career-high three walks April 10 against Kansas City in his first regular-season game at Wrigley Field since Sept. 28, 2015. He was leading the Cubs with 11 walks. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going good,&rdquo; said the 6-foot, 235-pounder. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel like I have to take a different approach. I take the same approach to at-bats and try to get on base and score as many runs as possible. That&rsquo;s a winning recipe.&rdquo; Manager Joe Maddon&rsquo;s reaction when asked his thoughts on Schwarber as the leadoff hitter? &ldquo;Love it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s doing a good job. He&rsquo;s been hitting the ball hard and accepting his walks. He&rsquo;s doing a good job in the outfield. He&rsquo;s striking out a little bit, but we knew that. It&rsquo;s very scary every time he&rsquo;s swung the bat. He&rsquo;s done a great job.&rdquo; April 7 was the one-year anniversary of Schwarber&rsquo;s injury, and the only knee-related work he&rsquo;s doing these days is maintenance. &ldquo;Mainly to keep my hips loose and things like that,&rdquo; he said. He was as concerned about finding tickets for his family, nine of whom were due for Friday&rsquo;s game, and looking forward to spending Saturday night at home, getting to know his newest nephew, Roman, the son of his sister Kelly. He considers that a good way for him to stay grounded and not get caught up in the hoopla of the Cubs winning their first World Series since 1908. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just trying to be the same kid from Middletown,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and keep grinding.&rdquo; -->\n<article class=\"story cm-channel-story cm-story cm-image\">\n\t    <a href=\"/sports/schwarber-occupies-rare-place-middletown-lore/L4rjuuUosWaB8n2ac4E1gO/\" class=\"story-photo-link\" target=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"/rf/image_inline/Pub/p8/DaytonDailyNews/2017/04/21/Images/newsEngin.18485543_668918672.jpg\" title=\"Schwarber occupies rare place in Middletown lore \" alt=\"Schwarber occupies rare place in Middletown lore \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"story-tease-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"story-title\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/sports/schwarber-occupies-rare-place-middletown-lore/L4rjuuUosWaB8n2ac4E1gO/\" target=\"\">Schwarber occupies rare place in Middletown lore </a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t        <p class=\"story-byline\">\n    \n\t    by\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nMark Schmetzer, <span class=\"story-source\">Contributing Writer</span>\n\t</p>\n<div class=\"story-text cm-truncate\" style=\"word-wrap: break-word; visibility: visible;\"><div>Kyle Schwarber isn’t too concerned about being one of the few Middletown products — perhaps only two — to have accomplished what he did last season.

People reported that &ldquo;The Barefoot Contessa&rdquo; shared with with Katie Couric&nbsp;why she and her husband of 48 years, Jeffrey,  decided &nbsp;not to have children. &ldquo;We decided not to have children,&rdquo; she said on an episode of &ldquo;The Katie Couric Podcast.&rdquo; &ldquo;I really appreciate that other people do and we will always have friends that have children that we are close to but it was a choice I made very early.&rdquo; &ldquo;I really felt, I feel, that I would have never been able to have the life I&rsquo;ve had,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;So it&rsquo;s a choice and that was the choice I made.&rdquo; Though there is sometimes a stigma surrounding couples that don&rsquo;t have kids, Garten said she never felt judged by her peers for her decision. &ldquo;I never felt that people did,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I think the one thing that we miss is a lot of people&rsquo;s friends are the parents of their kids&rsquo; friends. So we never had that connection with other people that I see, that network. But no I never felt judged by it. Maybe people did but I didn&rsquo;t notice.&rdquo; Garten also shared her own piece of advice when it comes to a loving and long-lasting marriage. &ldquo;The secret is that you just take care of each other and admire each other and support each other and you get that back,&rdquo; she said, adding, &ldquo;If Jeffrey and I disagree on something &mdash; he always agrees with me!&rdquo; -->\n<article class=\"story cm-channel-story cm-story cm-image\">\n\t    <a href=\"/entertainment/celebrity-news/ina-garten-shares-why-she-and-her-husband-decided-not-have-children/L9QMaf8ln0sZRn8ZokdIjI/\" class=\"story-photo-link\" target=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"/rf/image_inline/Pub/p8/CmgSharedContent/2017/04/21/Images/GettyImages-170718291-Rv8z6DKNt2cBRvk2my1RfcN-680x383.jpg\" title=\"Ina Garten shares why she and her husband decided to not have children \" alt=\"Ina Garten shares why she and her husband decided to not have children \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"story-tease-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"story-title\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/entertainment/celebrity-news/ina-garten-shares-why-she-and-her-husband-decided-not-have-children/L9QMaf8ln0sZRn8ZokdIjI/\" target=\"\">Ina Garten shares why she and her husband decided to not have children </a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t        <p class=\"story-byline\">\n    \n\t    by\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nNicole Moschella, Rare.us</p>\n<div class=\"story-text cm-truncate\" style=\"word-wrap: break-word; visibility: visible;\"><div>Children aren’t for everybody, and that’s the case for Food Network star Ina Garten.

Officials from the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency persuaded the U.S. EPA that reductions the brewery and air base made in converting from coal to gas more than offset the benefits of using a cleaner-burning gasoline that, based on 2016 prices, costs about 12 cents per gallon more than the gasoline used across Ohio during colder months. MORE: Lifting of emissions rule could lead to local gas pump savings For about a decade, the U.S. EPA has required use of &ldquo;low Reid Vapor Pressure&rdquo; gasoline from June 1 through Sept. 15, Ohio EPA Director Craig Butler said. The change is expected to save motorists $44 million in Butler, Clark, Clermont, Greene, Hamilton, Miami, Montgomery and Warren counties. Federal officials approved use of the low-RVP gas as a substitute for the unpopular &ldquo;e-check&rdquo; program in which vehicles used to have their tailpipe emissions routinely monitored. &ldquo;Nobody liked that (e-check program),&rdquo; Butler told this news organization. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t like it either, and we found that as air-quality improved, we could switch to this low-RVP program.&rdquo; But low-RVP fuel turned out to be more costly than the expected. &ldquo;We were able to make a very scientific case back to the federal EPA that we can relieve consumers from this hidden expense, and still see all of the environmental improvements, by these two facilities changing their boilers to natural gas,&rdquo; Butler said. The U.S. EPA expedited Ohio&rsquo;s request, &ldquo;so we could give guidance to the refiners, that they would not have to make this gasoline this year,&rdquo; Butler said. The Sierra Club and the air force base did not respond to requests for comment. Denise Quinn, plant manager at the Trenton brewery, said, &ldquo;We are constantly evaluating our processes in an effort to operate more efficiently, as sustainability is a key priority at Miller Coors.&rdquo; The brewery in January of 2016 permanently shut down two coal-fired boilers that were installed in 1981 and were used to make steam for the brewing process. The company spent more than $10 million in switching to a natural-gas process partly to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but also also to reduce costs &ldquo;and remain ahead of the curve when it comes to complying with increasingly stringent air quality requirements,&rdquo; Quinn said. Because of the change, the brewery&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions in 2016 decreased 37 percent; nitrogen oxide emissions droppedd 88 percent; and sulfur dioxide emissions decreased 96 percent, she said. Quinn added: &ldquo;The Trenton brewery is the first and only brewery in the country to receive recognition from U.S. EPA for achieving the Energy Star for Industry Challenge. To achieve recognition, the facility certified that it reduced the overall energy intensity of making beer by 10 percent.&rdquo; Meanwhile, at the brewery, Miller Coors has completed &ldquo;over 20 energy reduction efforts involving people and processes,&rdquo; and also has made numerous changes to reduce energy and water usage, Quinn said. The brewery in 2009 was the first Miller Coors brewery to become landfill-free, meaning, &ldquo;we reuse and recycle materials at a rate of over 99 percent&rdquo; Quinn added. &ldquo;The facility ships over 60,000 truckloads of beer per year, and for every five truckloads of beer produced, the brewery generates one truckload of co-products, recyclables and beneficially reused materials.&rdquo; -->\n<article class=\"story cm-channel-story cm-story cm-image\">\n\t    <a href=\"/news/local/butler-county-brewery-helps-lower-summer-gas-prices-for-motorists/KLj4oaBrbJJBVrHhVAOuKJ/\" class=\"story-photo-link\" target=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"/rf/image_inline/Pub/p8/DaytonDailyNews/2017/04/21/Images/newsEngin.18473843_012817-wls-StraightTalk.jpg\" title=\"Butler County brewery helps lower summer gas prices for motorists \" alt=\"Butler County brewery helps lower summer gas prices for motorists \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"story-tease-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"story-title\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/news/local/butler-county-brewery-helps-lower-summer-gas-prices-for-motorists/KLj4oaBrbJJBVrHhVAOuKJ/\" target=\"\">Butler County brewery helps lower summer gas prices for motorists </a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t        <p class=\"story-byline\">\n    \n\t    by\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nMike Rutledge, <span class=\"story-source\">Staff Writer</span>\n\t</p>\n<div class=\"story-text cm-truncate\" style=\"word-wrap: break-word; visibility: visible;\"><div>Thanks to pollution reductions at two major employers — Miller Coors Brewing in Trenton and Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton — gasoline prices in the Greater Cincinnati, Greater Dayton and Springfield areas will be about 12 cents lower per gallon than last summer.
