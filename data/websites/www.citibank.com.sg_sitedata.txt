You may at your reasonable discretion, vary, amend or modify any one or more provisions of these terms and conditions at any time after giving reasonable notice to me and such changes shall bind me and my legal representatives, successors, assigns and the beneficiaries of my estate.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>3. Where you in your reasonable discretion make Citibank Online available to me, I shall be allocated an ATM-PIN, which you shall notify to me. I will also be allocated a CIN if I do not already have one. I shall access Citibank Online using (i) my User ID and Password which I may obtain via registration on Citibank Online using my CIN and ATM-PIN or (ii) Touch ID Sensor which I may obtain via registration on Citibank's mobile application using my User ID and Password and OTP. I can generate a new User ID and/or Password in such manner as you may prescribe from time to time. I understand that Touch ID Sensor is optional and that my activating Touch ID Sensor enables any fingerprint saved on the Customer's Terminal, whether now or in the future, to be used to access to Citibank Online. Accordingly, I agree not to activate Touch ID Sensor and to immediately de-activate Touch ID Sensor on Citibank's mobile application if any other person's fingerprint is saved, whether now or in the future, on the Customer's Terminal. In the event any other person's fingerprint is saved on the Customer's Terminal and I activate or continue to access Citibank Online using Touch ID Sensor despite the condition above, I understand that such person, using his or her fingerprint, will be able to access my Account(s) and perform transactions through the Citibank mobile application. I agree that the access of my Account(s) and performance of these transactions by such person will be considered as authorised by me and I shall be responsible and liable for the same. In order to effect banking transactions through Citibank Online, I shall in addition to the CIN, ATM-PIN, User ID and Password be allocated an OTP. I shall gain access to Citibank Online for purposes of effecting banking transactions upon the correct input of my User ID, Password and OTP into the Customer's Terminal and/or upon the recognition of any fingerprint stored on the Customer's Terminal using Touch ID Sensor. I am responsible for keeping, and shall take every precaution to keep my CIN, ATM-PIN, User ID, Password, OTP as well as any other information that can be used to register or generate my User ID and Password confidential (including but not limited to not revealing my CIN, ATM-PIN, User ID, Password and OTP to any third party and taking all steps to prevent discovery of my CIN, ATM-PIN, User ID, Password and OTP by any third party). I am responsible for taking every precaution to prevent any third party from storing any fingerprint in the Customer's Terminal. I am responsible for keeping, and ensuring that only my fingerprint(s) are saved on the Customer's Terminal. This information by itself or together with information on my Account(s) may allow unauthorised access to and/or operation of my Account(s). For security purposes, I undertake your recommendation that I memorise my User ID, Password and OTP (instead of recording it down) and that I change my Password regularly. I may change my User ID or Password from time to time by using Change User ID or Password screen within Citibank Online, and you will be entitled at your reasonable discretion to reject any of my selection as my substitute User ID or Password without giving any reason therefore. I agree that you shall not be liable in anyway whatsoever for any unauthorised registration of User ID and Password, and after such registration, any subsequent generation of the User ID and Password. In the event that my User ID and Password is registered, generated, disclosed or discovered by any third party, I shall immediately change my User ID or Password. I am responsible for the use and operation of my Account(s), whether or not authorised by me. You shall not be liable for any loss I suffer as a result of any unauthorised use of my CIN, ATM-PIN, User ID, Password and/or OTP, or Touch ID Sensor except in the case of your gross negligence or wilful default.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>4. Where you in your reasonable discretion make Citibank Online available to me, I shall be allowed to have direct access to my Account(s) or to effect certain banking transactions by electronic means via a Customer's Terminal, or any other computer system through which access may be effected by any use of my User ID and Password. I am responsible for keeping, and shall take every precaution to keep, such Customer's Terminal and such other computer system free from any electronic, mechanical, data failure or corruption, or Malware. I agree that you shall not be liable in anyway whatsoever for any unauthorised transactions effected in subversion of any authentication process put in place by you. I am responsible for the use, operation and access to my Account(s) through any Customer's Terminal or such other computer system. You shall not be liable for any loss suffered by me as a result of any unauthorised use of my Account(s) or my CIN, ATM-PIN, User ID, Password and/or OTP effected through any means, except in the case of your gross negligence or wilful default.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>5. I authorise you to notify me of my OTP via SMS or OSD. If notification is via SMS, I understand that you will send the SMS notification to my mobile phone number that you have on record. I acknowledge that in order for you to notify me of my OTP via SMS, I must provide you with my current mobile phone number. I agree with at you shall not be liable if I am unable to gain access to my OTP. If you have provided me with an OSD, I agree not to disassemble, decompile, copy, modify or reverse engineer the OSD or assist anyone else to do so whether directly or indirectly.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>6. I authorise you to act upon any instructions, which are identified by any use of my User ID, Password and, OTP (\"and/or Touch ID Sensor (\"Citibank Online Use\").\"), whether or not authorised by me, and regardless of any subversion of any authentication process put in place by you. Such instructions, upon receipt by you, shall be effected at your reasonable discretion.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>7. The Facilities are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. However, some or all of the Facilities that may be accessed through Citibank Online may not be available at certain times due to the maintenance and/or malfunction of the Citibank system. In the event of such unavailability, I may call 24-Hour CitiPhone Banking at (65) 6225-5225 or visit a Citibank branch to conduct my banking transactions. I agree that you will not be responsible for the timeliness, deletion, mis-delivery or failure to store any user data, communications or personalised settings or my failure to access Citibank Online or any of the Facilities, except in the case of your gross negligence or wilful default. I acknowledge and agree that my role is extremely important in the prevention of any unauthorised use or operation of my Account(s). I undertake to promptly examine my statements upon receipt. If I discover any discrepancies, omissions, debits wrongly made, inaccuracies or incorrect entries in my statement, I must immediately call 24-Hour CitiPhone Banking at (65) 6225-5225.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>8. If I believe that my User ID, Password and/or OTP may have been lost or stolen, or that someone has accessed my Account(s) information, transferred or may transfer money from my Account(s) or otherwise has operated my Account(s) without my permission, I should notify you immediately by calling 24-Hour CitiPhone Banking at (65) 6225-5225.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>9. You shall be entitled but not obliged to investigate the authenticity or authority of persons registering or generating my User ID, Password, OTP and/or Touch ID Sensor. You shall not be responsible for verifying the accuracy and completeness of my instructions given via Citibank Online, nor shall you be liable for acting upon any instructions given using a successfully created User ID, Password, OTP and/or Touch ID Sensor, effecting my instructions or verifying the accuracy and completeness of my instructions. Subject to the foregoing, such instructions shall be deemed irrevocable and binding on me upon your receipt of the same notwithstanding any error, lack of clarity or misunderstanding in respect of the terms of such instructions. I shall notify you immediately upon receipt of incomplete, garbled or inaccurate data or information from you. I shall also notify you immediately upon receipt of any data or information which is not intended for me and I shall delete such data or information from the Customer's Terminal immediately.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>10. I shall accept full responsibility for any access to Citibank Online using my User ID, Password, OTP and/or Touch ID Sensor and all transactions executed via Citibank Online and in particular for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of my instructions.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>11. I agree that you may in your reasonable discretion but without prior notice to me cancel or refuse to execute my instructions at any time without furnishing any reason and without incurring any liability.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>12. You shall be entitled but not obliged to verify any instructions given via Citibank Online by calling back online or via telephone or any other means.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>13. I represent that to the best of my knowledge, the Customer's Terminal and any other computer system through which access may be effected by any use of my User ID and Password or Touch ID Sensor are free from any electronic, mechanical, data failure or corruption or Malware. I agree that neither you, any branches or subsidiaries of Citibank, N.A. are responsible for any electronic, mechanical, data failure, corruption or Malware or related problems that may be attributable to Facilities provided by any internet service provider or information service provider, network provider, content provider, any server or such other equivalent system.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>14.
