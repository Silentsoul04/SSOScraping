You can also own houses, own and sell items at businesses, buy car bombs, grow and sell \"drugs\", do one of the many vehicle missions, or kill some of the people with bounties on their heads. You can rob casinos, stores, houses, businesses, and other players. The more risk you take, the more money you get - just don't get caught!</p>\n<p>If you don't already have SA:MP, you should go and read more about it on our <a href=\"https://www.sacnr.com/downloads/\">downloads page</a> - it's fun!</p>\n<p>For more information about SACNR, please visit our <a href=\"https://www.sacnr.com/about/\">About page</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n\n<div class=\"home_news\">\n\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.sacnr.com/posts/136-happy-easter-/\">Happy Easter!</a></h2>\n<h3 class=\"updated\">14th Apr 2017</h3>\n<p>\n\t<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/iZeoA17.jpg\" style=\"width: 607px; height: auto;\"></p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tEaster has rolled around again!

Rest assured, we've \"un\"-balanced them now.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlthough we joked in the last post about the <a href=\"/vote\">voting platform</a> ideas, this is the update where you can find the first batch of implementations. We've got more planned and already have items assigned to a future release.</p>\n<p>\n\tSome items for this update in no particular order:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t\tYou will now receive more score for risker jobs, such as robbing banks or casinos.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tYou will now receive score for robbing houses and businesses.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tWe now have a visible hit timer inside /hits, /hi, /myhits and as a textdraw if you're the player with the hit.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tRelated to the above change, you'll notice hits now last 24 ingame hours, truth is, they've always lasted 24 but the line in chat was bugged.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t$ldmg is now red.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tImplemented button trade.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tJobs with timers (like bus driving) will now show a timer with how long you've been doing that job.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tAdded Leviathan at Bayside.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tBids are cancelled if the amount of cash you have drops below the amount you bid.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tAdded a female army skin.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tCops can now arrest suspects by shooting them as long as they're in arrest range.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tCasino betting limit is now set to $2.5 million by popular demand.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t/houses and /businesses now show your last visits.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t/crimes will show how long ago the crime was committed.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tRemoved button trade.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tAccepting a bribe will deduct one point from the cop for being dirty.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t... However, max bribe is now set to $50k. Choose wisely.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tSACNR's HUD elements can now be removed with /hud.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t/cityinfo, /druginfo and /plants now auto refresh like /info.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tFixed a bug where post bank letters would charge the wrong fee.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tAllow friends and group members to enter your locked vehicles.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tFriends who also have keys to your house can quit and rejoin inside.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tYou can use a lock pick and /robcar to try to steal a locked vehicle.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tWe'll have more stuff soon but for now, we hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>\n\tAs always, please report any bugs you may find on the forums.</p>\n<p>\n\tCheers,<br>\n\tYour friendly SACNR Dev Team</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n\t\t\t\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.sacnr.com/posts/134-aw-hell-yeah/\">AW HELL YEAH</a></h2>\n<h3 class=\"updated\">1st Apr 2017</h3>\n<p>\n\tWhen we pushed live the voting platform just over 2 weeks ago, we didn't expect it to get the response it did, we've been blown away with the reaction and knew we needed to do something about it</p>\n<p>\n\tThe dev team has been working night and day with no sleep and no breaks to make the server a better place.</p>\n<h3>\n\tCop balance</h3>\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t\tWe've re-balanced some of the vehicle spawns you find around airports. Everyone knows that cops are scared of flying so it's likely only civilians will find these.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tA new off-road vehicle has been added to the car shop. Police pay isn't high enough to buy this though, so no worries again.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tTime and time again, we heard about some of the OP weapons that cops get. We hear you. As of today, the standard issue nitestick has been replaced.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\n\tCIA Features</h3>\n<p>\n\tIt's not all about civilians, CIAs are supposed to be undercover, so we've added a new undercover CIA vehicle to police garages. This is exclusive to CIA players. Cops are already OP and don't get this amazing new vehicle.</p>\n<h3>\n\tDeath and destruction</h3>\n<p>\n\tLarger car bomb available? huh? Certified unsafe? eh? Rediculous range? what?</p>\n<h3>\n\tAmmunation</h3>\n<p>\n\tThere's a new weapon on the block, and she's a beauty.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs always, let us know how you get on, have fun</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"font-size:10px;\"><small>(On a serious note, normal rules still apply, but please have fun)</small></span></p>\n\n</div>\n\t\t\t\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.sacnr.com/posts/133-sacnr-suggestion-fest/\">SACNR Suggestion-fest</a></h2>\n<h3 class=\"updated\">19th Mar 2017</h3>\n<p>Hi all,</p>\n<p>Following some discussion on the forums in <a href=\"https://forum.sacnr.com/threads/44626-Truck0r-s-annual-come-and-save-sacnr-thread\" target=\"_blank\">this thread</a>, I've created a new page for people to quickly suggest ideas and then up/down vote them depending on how important they think they are to the server.</p>\n\n<p>You can find it <a href=\"/vote\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The page is open to anyone currently unbanned, doesn't matter if you're a player or an admin, all suggestions are welcome</p>\n\n<p>The more votes we get, the better idea we have of what you guys would like implemented next so please tell your friends/group members/enemies to come vote too.</p>\n\n<p>Votes will be kept private, allowing people to vote honestly and not worry about what anyone else thinks - admins won't be able to see this list either.</p> \n\n<p>If you have any questions, I've left an FAQ at the bottom of the page, but please ask me on IRC if you need info about anything else.</p><br>\n\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Jamie</p>\n<br><br>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.sacnr.com/posts/132-new-donation-perks/\">New Donation Perks</a></h2>\n<h3 class=\"updated\">11th Jan 2017</h3>\n<p>\n\tYou may remember a few years ago, we ran a donation promotion which gave out promo tokens and allowed people to exchange them for a special vehicle in the car shop.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tToday, we've started a new promotion for people <strong>using PayPal</strong> to support the server costs. Each donation will be given 5 tokens, these can be exchanged for new house interiors, a new business interior (more interiors coming soon), extended spawn options, doubled vehicle service pay <strike>and business icons</strike>. For more information, look out for the \"S\" icon in San Fierro - this marks the <a href=\"https://sacnr.com/map/-2460/360/\">SACNR Headquarters building</a>.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tMore services will be added over time, we have some ideas in the works, including a much requested option to remove the name change cooldown.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tPlease note, these donation tokens will <strong>only be given to players who donate using PayPal</strong>. PayGol charges us a large percentage to use their service and so less of the donation money actually gets to us.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks to all of our donors for supporting SACNR, you help keep the server running for everyone else and it would be difficult to do this without you.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<hr>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tWe've also implemented the prizes for the 2016 Christmas Event winners:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t\tTeam Santa players with at least 1 gift will be given 1 token.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tNikke (3rd place) will be given 2 tokens.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tBLACK_DEATH (2nd Place) Will be given 3 tokens.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tJeeperCreeper (Winner of Grinch team) will be given his extra property slots</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tScarface_capone (Overall winner) Will be given his extra property slots and 3 tokens.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n\n</div>\n\t\t\t<a class=\"news-archive\" href=\"https://www.sacnr.com/all-posts/\">News archive</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"home_online\">\n\n<div class=\"online_players\">\n<h2>Players online</h2><span class=\"number\">16</span><ul>\n\t<li class=\"\">\n\t\t<a href=\"https://www.sacnr.com/u/brad/\">brad</a>\n\t</li>\n\t\n\t<li class=\"\">\n\t\t<a href=\"https://www.sacnr.com/u/Viper_16/\">Viper_16</a>\n\t</li>\n\t\n\t<li class=\"\">\n\t\t<a href=\"https://www.sacnr.com/u/xianine/\">xianine</a>\n\t</li>\n\t\n\t<li class=\"\">\n\t\t<a href=\"https://www.sacnr.com/u/Tikboy12/\">Tikboy12</a>\n\t</li>\n\t\n\t<li class=\"\">\n\t\t<a href=\"https://www.sacnr.com/u/Nuon/\">Nuon</a>\n\t</li>\n\t\n\t<li class=\"\">\n\t\t<a href=\"https://www.sacnr.com/u/jackrana/\">jackrana</a>\n\t</li>\n\t\n\t<li class=\"\">\n\t\t<a href=\"https://www.sacnr.com/u/AngelOfWar/\">AngelOfWar</a>\n\t</li>\n\t\n\t<li class=\"\">\n\t\t<a href=\"https://www.sacnr.com/u/ardie03/\">ardie03</a>\n\t</li>\n\t\n\t<li class=\"\">\n\t\t<a href=\"https://www.sacnr.com/u/Robi_Kanchiel/\">Robi_Kanchiel</a>\n\t</li>\n\t\n\t<li class=\"\">\n\t\t<a href=\"https://www.sacnr.com/u/Lt.ngentot/\">Lt.ngentot</a>\n\t</li>\n\t\n\t<li class=\"\">\n\t\t<a href=\"https://www.sacnr.com/u/Zedojong/\">Zedojong</a>\n\t</li>\n\t\n\t<li class=\"donator\">\n\t\t<a href=\"https://www.sacnr.com/u/zeref420/\">zeref420</a>\n\t</li>\n\t\n\t<li class=\"donator\">\n\t\t<a href=\"https://www.sacnr.com/u/Girlfriends/\">Girlfriends</a>\n\t</li>\n\t\n\t<li class=\"\">\n\t\t<a href=\"https://www.sacnr.com/u/420kulafo/\">420kulafo</a>\n\t</li>\n\t\n\t<li class=\"\">\n\t\t<a href=\"https://www.sacnr.com/u/Jimjoseph10/\">Jimjoseph10</a>\n\t</li>\n\t\n\t<li class=\"\">\n\t\t<a href=\"https://www.sacnr.com/u/superdog_06/\">superdog_06</a>\n\t</li>\n\t</ul>\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div id=\"footer\">\n\t\t\t\t<p>© 2017.
