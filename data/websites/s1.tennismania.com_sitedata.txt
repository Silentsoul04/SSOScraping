home in Bratislava as a three-year-old with my father Milan and the success came gradually. I was the tennis Talent of the Year in Slovakia in 2005 when I won the European Championship under 16 title. The following year I won the junior grand slam tournament French Open. I have won five singles and four doubles tournaments on the ATP World Tour circuit in my career so far and I have never been beaten in a final. I have won ten singles titles on the ATP Challenger and Futures circuits. In the ATP ranking I have been ranked as high as 24 in singles in April 2015 and 73 in doubles in May 2015. Since the end of 2015 I have been coached by former Slovak tennis player Martin Hromec. My specific feature is that I play left-handed.</div> </div>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n\n        </div>  </div>\n</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<div class=\"welcome-bottom\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"welcome-bottom-bg\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"welcome-bottom-bg-line\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"welcome-bottom-bg-line-mobile welcome-xs-display\">\n\t\t\t\t\t  Copyright © 2011-2017 \n\t\t\t\t\t  - <a href=\"http://www.powerplaymanager.com/games/tm_cross/\" target=\"_blank\">POWERPLAY MANAGER, s.r.o.</a> \n\t\t\t\t\t  <!--  <span class=\"welcome-xxs-no-display\">-</span><span class=\"welcome-xxs-display\"></span>  -->\n\t\t\t\t\t  <div>All rights reserved</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n<div class=\"welcome-footer\">\n  <div class=\"welcome-footer-top\">\n    <div class=\"welcome-container welcome-clearfix\">\n\n      <div id=\"welcome-trainer-info\" class=\"welcome-trainer-info-wrapper\">\n  <div class=\"welcome-trainer-info-inner\">\n    <div class=\"welcome-trainer-info-skew-bg\">\n      <div class=\"welcome-trainer-info-skew-bg-top\"></div>\n      <div class=\"welcome-trainer-info-skew-bg-bottom\"></div>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"welcome-trainer-info-text\">\n      <div class=\"welcome-trainer-info-title\">\n        Martin Kližan\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"welcome-trainer-info-desc\">\n        Pro tennis player      </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"welcome-trainer-info-icon\"></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n      <a href=\"http://www.powerplaymanager.com/games/tm_cross/\" class=\"welcome-footer-top-logo welcome-xs-no-display\">\n        <img src=\"https://appspowerplaymanager.vshcdn.net/images/tennismania/homepage-new/homepage-logo-powerplay-manager.png\" alt=\"Powerplay Manager\" title=\"Powerplay Manager\">\n      </a>\n      <div class=\"welcome-footer-top-menu\">\n        <div class=\"welcome-footer-top-menu-inner welcome-clearfix\">\n          <ul class=\"welcome-clearfix\">   \n            <li><a href=\"#welcome-about-new\" class=\"fancybox\">About the game</a></li>\n            <li class=\"welcome-xs-no-display\"><a href=\"#\" class=\"fancybox-gallery\" data-open-id=\"welcome-gallery\">Gallery</a></li>\n            <li><a href=\"mailto:support@tennismania.com\" target=\"_blank\">Contact</a></li>\n            <li><a href=\"http://www.powerplaymanager.com/games/tm_cross/\" target=\"_blank\">More games</a></li>\n          </ul>\n\n          <div class=\"welcome-footer-top-menu-social welcome-clearfix\">\n                      <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/tennismaniagame\" class=\"welcome-footer-top-menu-social-fb\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Facebook\"></a>\n            <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tennismaniagame\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"welcome-footer-top-menu-social-tw\"></a>\n                    </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"welcome-footer-bottom\">\n    <div class=\"welcome-container welcome-clearfix\">\n      <div class=\"welcome-footer-bottom-menu\">\n        <a href=\"#welcome-license\" class=\"fancybox\">Terms of Service</a>\n        <a href=\"#welcome-privacy-policy\" class=\"fancybox\">Privacy Policy</a> \n      </div>\n      <div class=\"welcome-footer-bottom-copyright welcome-xs-no-display\">\n        Copyright © 2011-2017 \n        - <a href=\"http://www.powerplaymanager.com/games/tm_cross/\" target=\"_blank\">POWERPLAY MANAGER, s.r.o.</a> \n        - All rights reserved      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div id=\"welcome-about\" class=\"welcome-popup\">\n  <div class=\"welcome-popup-inner\">\n    <div class=\"welcome-popup-content scrollbar-light ps-container ps-theme-default\" data-ps-id=\"da9394a8-95a1-f677-e142-8400dc1bf23d\">\n      <div class=\"welcome-about-content\">\n        <div class=\"welcome-about-head\">\n          <img src=\"https://appspowerplaymanager.vshcdn.net/images/tennismania/homepage-new/homepage-logo-tennismania-small.png\" alt=\"Tennismania\" title=\"Tennismania\">\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"welcome-about-body\">\n          <div class=\"welcome-about-title\">\n            Tennis Mania          </div>\n          \n          <div class=\"welcome-about-text\">\n            <p>\n              Tennis Mania is an online sports tennis game where you can live the life of a professional tennis player.

The game is provided on the basis of a license. The operator enables the user to buy gems for a fee which enable the user to purchase, at the user's sole discretion, virtual services that increase the comfort of the gameplay. Gems are a virtual currency which the user can use within the game exclusively and under the terms and conditions specified in these ToS (hereinafter as \"gems\").</li><li>The \"game\" denotes software programs distributed, published or otherwise available via the operator including, but not limited to, available via a browser or other online communication method and downloadable/installable for mobile phones and other devices.</li><li>The game is designed for devices supporting internet browsers (e.g. Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox) always in their current version or devices using the Android or iOS operating systems.</li><li>The operator provides virtual services enhancing the experience and comfort of the game, which are grouped in the so-called PREMIUM packs and the Add-ons pack.

If the operator terminates operation of the server, the validity of the \"lifetime\" feature pack is automatically terminated as well.</li><li>The operator reserves the right to modify, amend, remove or add features to feature packs at any time without prior notice. In such cases the users are not entitled to claim any compensation or refund of gems or money.</li><li>The operator reserves the right to modify, amend, remove or add feature packs at any time without prior notice. In case a feature pack is removed from the offer, it will not be possible to activate it any more.

The user directly influences the result e.g. by the way he/she trains his/her character or by the equipment he/she has bought for the character. Therefore the results of the individual matches are not based on randomness, but on the strategy chosen by the user.</li><li>The user is entitled to a refund of money paid on tennismania.com domain and used to purchase gems or other virtual services and/or gems used to activate the feature packs or other virtual services only under the following conditions:     \n    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n    a) The operator will refund the gems to the user used on activation of any of the PREMIUM packs only at the first activation of this pack by the user.

The money will be refunded within 30 days from the reception of the request.</li><li>If the user is using the game on third party platforms, the operator does not refund money spent by the user on these platforms on the purchase of gems or other virtual services sold by the operator for real money. In such cases, the refund of money spent on gems or other virtual services sold by the operator for real money is at the sole discretion of the platform operators and subject to terms valid for the respective platform.</li><li>If the user requests a refund of money and this refund is processed, the operator has the right to block the respective user account.</li></ol><div class=\"license-body-block-title\">Art. 3 – Registration of the user for the game / Installation of the game</div><ol class=\"license-body-block-text\"><li>The user expresses his/her unqualified assent to these ToS, Privacy Policy and rules of the game by registering in the game or installing the game on his/her device, acknowledges that the ToS and Privacy Policy are only available in English and Slovak languages, agrees with this fact and understands their content.

A repeated violation of the rules by the same user will result in an immediate and irrevocable block of the user's account.
