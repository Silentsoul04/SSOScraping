In states or regions that impose sales or use tax, a purchase is subject to tax unless specifically exempt. Purchases from the MyMeter Entities are not exempt from sales or use taxes simply because they are made from the Internet or because MyMeter Entities is not required to collect sales or use tax by any particular state or region. Whether any sales tax will be collected on a given purchase and the amount of tax charged depends on a number of factors including whether the seller is subject to tax in a given jurisdiction. The purchaser is responsible for any applicable taxes not collected by MyMeter Entities and certain states require purchasers to file a sales/use tax return annually reporting taxable purchases that were not taxed and to pay such tax. For details, see the website of, or otherwise contact, the applicable taxing authority. If any sales tax will be collected directly by MyMeter Entities in connection with a purchase that amount will be shown either prior to the completion of any purchase or reflected in the final confirmation of that purchase.</p>\n                \n                <ol start=\"4\">\n                    <li>VOTES; GAMES; CONTESTS; SWEEPSTAKES</li>\n                </ol>\n                \n                <p>This Website and other MyMeter Entities may offer you opportunities to vote in connection with certain events and also to enter games, contests and sweepstakes.
