As I study God's Word, our history, and the world around us, I'm compelled to write about what I find. These studies leave me with a strengthened faith and a better understanding of God and our own human nature. I can only hope that it inspires the same in others. The world is becoming increasingly violent against the Bible and it's message, both spiritually and physically, and that's something I've come to accept. I find that everything in life points to or away from Christ. Much like love, this faith is a choice and must be continually nurtured lest it die.</p>\n\t\n\t<h1>What's in a Name</h1>\n\t<p>Why Riding the Beast? I was fairly new to Bible study when this domain was registered. The Hebrew letter Vav is both a W and a six so the www prefixing most domains could be interpreted as a literal 666. Could the Internet itself be the beast of Revelation? It was a naive interpretation but nevertheless, here the name remains.</p>\n\t<p>So who's riding the beast? Babylon the Great, Mother of Harlots and Abominations of the Earth. Plain and simply false doctrine, false religion, and false beliefs. The reality is that we all have some level of falsity in our belief systems and we're all subject to the desires of the flesh - power, sex, money, fame, goods, and substances of all kinds. We're all riding the beast to some degree and we'll all eventually receive the consequence of death. The good news is that Christ Jesus conquered death and His gift of life is available to all, for everyone to accept, or to reject.</p>\n\t<p>Many prefer to quibble over the name by which we should call our Savior. Whether it be Jesus, Yeshua, Jehova, Jah, The Christ, The Annointed, or The Messiah, the redeeming work on the cross and the glorious resurrection are the same. Many get caught up in the image of a \"white Jesus\" or arrogant Christians, televangelists, and pedophile priests. Others claim that Jesus was just another man, or only a prophet, or simply a myth. Some are content with a higher power but an unknowable God. There are plenty of reasons not to believe in the saving grace of God through Jesus Christ.</p>\n\n\t<h1>Testimony</h1>\n\t<p>I'm a young man who is a software engineer by trade and a Christian by faith. As I've matured I've come to realize that all that glitters is not in fact gold. The things that looked so good from a distance lost their appeal as I approached them. What I was chasing I cannot exactly tell. It's not hard to say that a big part of it was myself. When everyone is trying to define the next person, it gets quite easy to lose our own true essence in the mix.</p>\n\t<p>For me, the ultimate test of faith is believing that God wants to communicate with us directly through the written Word, and that He has power not only of life and death but also of resurrection. If one can believe in the resurrection of Christ, then a creation in six days, a global flood, a parting of the seas, and a time of the end are not hard to accept - regardless of how improbable they seem to the modern world. This faith can be as simple or as complex as we choose to make it but everything in the Holy Bible points to the Savior Jesus Christ and we ultimately choose who to follow.</p>\n\n\t<h1>Dedication</h1>\n\t<p>This site is dedicated to both believers and non-believer alike. It's also dedicated to my father who is currently serving a 14 year prison term, a tribulation of his own. Every attempt is made to respect all faiths and beliefs but this site represents my own perspective as a Christian and an American. With that said, I feel comfortable adding that if you've made it this far, it <i>is</i> for a reason.</p>\n\n\t<h1>Inspiration</h1>\n\t<img src=\"images/beastialities.gif\" alt=\"MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH - Revelation 17:4-5\" width=\"348\" height=\"238\" usemap=\"#RI\" border=\"0\" hspace=\"5\"><img src=\"images/to_pieces.gif\" alt=\"Not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit, saith the LORD of hosts. - Zechariah 4:6\" width=\"202\" height=\"238\" hspace=\"5\">\n\n</div>\t\t\n\t</div>\n\t<div id=\"sidebar\">\n\t\n\t<a href=\"/articles/rfid-implants-nfc-payment-mark-of-the-beast/\" title=\"RFID implants, NFC payment and the Mark of the Beast\"><img src=\"/images/verichip.png\" alt=\"Verichip Implant and the Mark of the Beast\" border=\"0\" width=\"120\" height=\"67\"></a><br>\n\n\t<a href=\"/articles/666-hand-or-forehead/\" title=\"Mark of the Beast in the Hand or Forehead?\"><img src=\"/images/chip-forehead.png\" alt=\"Mark of the Beast in the Hand or Forehead?\" border=\"0\" width=\"120\" height=\"72\"></a><br>\n\n\t<a href=\"/articles/pre-trib-rapture/\" title=\"An Introduction to The Pre-Trib Rapture\"><img src=\"/images/rapture.png\" alt=\"An Introduction to The Pre-Trib Rapture\" border=\"0\" width=\"120\" height=\"57\"></a><br>\n\n\t<a href=\"/articles/epi-charagma-chi-xi-stigma/\" title=\"Verichip and 666 - Bite of the Serpent\"><img src=\"/images/serpent-bite.png\" alt=\"Verichip and 666 - Bite of the Serpent\" border=\"0\" width=\"120\" height=\"105\"></a><br>\n\n\t<a href=\"/articles/666-physical-mark/\" title=\"Mark of the Beast - a Physical Mark\"><img src=\"/images/punchcard.png\" alt=\"Mark of the Beast - Biblical References to a Physical Mark\" border=\"0\" width=\"120\" height=\"71\"></a><br>\n\n\t<a href=\"/articles/fishytale/\" title=\"Christian Fish\"><img src=\"/images/christian-fish.png\" alt=\"Christian Fish\" border=\"0\" width=\"120\" height=\"39\"></a><br>\n\n\t<a href=\"/articles/gold-money-666/\" title=\"Gold, 666, Gold Money\"><img src=\"/images/euro-666.png\" alt=\"Gold, Money and The Mark of the Beast 666\" border=\"0\" width=\"120\" height=\"57\"></a><br>\n\n\n\t<a href=\"http://biblos.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/images/biblos.png?1\" alt=\"Biblos.com\" border=\"0\" width=\"120\" height=\"20\"></a><br>\n\t<a href=\"http://www.execulink.com/~wblank/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/images/study_your_bible.gif\" alt=\"Daily Bible Study - Get Your Daily Dose!\" border=\"0\" width=\"120\" height=\"16\"></a><br>\n\t<a href=\"http://www.studylight.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/images/studylight.gif\" alt=\"StudyLight.org - Study Resources!\" border=\"0\" width=\"120\" height=\"16\"></a><br>\t\t \n\t<a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/images/bible-gateway-alt.gif\" alt=\"Bible Gateway.com - Search God's Word!\" border=\"0\" width=\"120\" height=\"22\"></a><br>\n\t<a href=\"http://www.crosswire.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/images/crosswire.gif\" alt=\"The Crosswire Bible Society - Free Study Tools!\" border=\"0\" width=\"120\" height=\"25\"></a><br>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"spaced\">\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t</div>\n\t<div id=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"footer\"><p>Copyright Â© 2002-2017 RidingTheBeast.com</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"navtxt\" class=\"navtext\" style=\"padding: 0px;\"></div>\n\n\n<div id=\"toolTip\" style=\"top: -20em; visibility: hidden;\"></div></body>"}
