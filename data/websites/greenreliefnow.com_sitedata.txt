that many experts call it <b>the body’s natural painkiller ...</b></h2>\n\n\n\n            <p>And today many of the most powerful pain drugs on the market, including opiates, simply mimic what

there are many different types of cannabinoids...<br><br>\n\n\n\n            Including a very special one called “cannabidiol”, or CBD for short. <br><br>\n\n\n\n            Commercially, CBD is most

major studies.</p>\n\n\n\n            <p class=\"boldtext\">In a study of 2,495 patients published in Fibromyalgia Today ...</p>\n\n\n\n            <h2 class=\"centerheading\"><i>100% of patients using CBD to treat their fibromyalgia (muscle pain) reported less pain or discomfort after being on CBD therapy for at least 30 days.</i></h2>\n\n\n\n            <h2 class=\"centerheading\"><i>This

<p class=\"boldtext\">Then there’s a November 2016 study published in the journal of Experimental Biology ....</p>\n\n\n\n            <h2 class=\"centerheading\"><i>Where it was found that CBD is

was a randomized, double-blind, and placebo controlled...<br><br>\n\n\n\n            63 patients with neuropathic pain were given CBD...<br><br>\n\n\n\n            While 62 were given a placebo (sugar

<ul class=\"tick\">            \n\n\n\n                <li>CBD is nothing short of a miracle when it comes to managing your chronic pain.</li>                \n\n\n\n                <li>You also know

<p>So with all of this being said...</p>\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            <p class=\"boldtext\">You’re probably wondering...</p>\n\n\n\n            <h2 class=\"centerheading\"><i>“why on Earth was hemp banned by the government for over 70 years?”</i></h2>\n\n\n\n            <p class=\"boldtext\">And you’re also probably curious about where to find the best form of this healing CBD oil right now...</p>\n\n\n\n            <p class=\"boldtext\"><u>So that you can start trying out this health breakthrough for yourself...and share it with your loved ones too.</u> </p>\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            <p>Well to answer the first question: why did the government ban hemp if it was so good for you?<br><br>\n\n\n\n            The answer is the same as it always is: they caved into powerful elites whose financial interests were at odds with the American people.<br><br>\n\n\n\n            You see: societies have used hemp from thousands of years...<br><br>\n\n\n\n            And up until the 1930s hemp was also a very popular “cash crop” in America that was used to make clothing, paper, and other products.<br><br>\n\n\n\n            But in the 1930s Publishing Magnate William Randolph Hearst...industrialist Lamont DuPont...and U.S. Secretary of Treasury Andrew Mellon all joined together in an effort to make hemp illegal.<br><br>\n\n\n\n            Why?<br><br>\n\n\n\n            Well Dupont was working on a new process to make paper from wood...<br><br>\n\n\n\n            Meanwhile Hearst was the largest owners of forests in the U.S...<br><br>\n\n\n\n            And paper is of course made from wood.<br><br>\n\n\n\n            Additionally both Hearst and Dupont had financial interests in synthetic fiber and petroleum...<br><br>\n\n\n\n            Both of which competed directly against hemp clothing.<br><br>\n\n\n\n            So they did what the ultra-greedy have been doing since the beginning of time...<br><br>\n\n\n\n            <span class=\"boldtext\">They pressured Andrew Mellon and the government to make the possession or transfer of Hemp in the United States illegal without a permit.</span><br><br>\n\n\n\n            And then they made sure that permits were very hard to find. <br><br>\n\n\n\n            <span class=\"boldtext\">Everyday Americans went along with this because Hearst and Dupont associated hemp with marijuana –<u> even though the two are entirely different...</u></span><br><br>\n\n\n\n            And for the next 77 years, hemp was shut off from every day Americans like you and me. <br><br>\n\n\n\n            <span class=\"boldtext\">In February, 2014 all of that changed however...</span><br><br>\n\n\n\n            When President Obama signed the 2014 Farm Bill...<br><br>\n\n\n\n            Which contained a special amendment to legalize the production of industrial Hemp in the United States.<br><br>\n\n\n\n            What’s more, the U.S. Government went a step further and even patented CBD Oil, which is the healthiest part of Hemp...<br><br>\n\n\n\n            Saying that CBD...</p>\n\n\n\n            <ul class=\"tick\">\n\n\n\n            <li>Protects the brain and supports healthy blood and oxygen flow...</li>\n\n\n\n            <li>Acts as a neuroprotectant that can limit damage in cases of stroke or trauma, and treat degenerative diseases including dementia...</li>\n\n\n\n            <li>Protects the cells of the nervous system and brain...</li>\n\n\n\n            <li>Has an anti-anxiety effect...</li>\n\n\n\n            <li>Supports the nutritional health of aging bodies...</li>\n\n\n\n            </ul>\n\n\n\n            <p>And so much more.<br><br>\n\n\n\n            <span class=\"boldtext\">This patent is also remarkable because it’s the first time since the 1930s that ANY Government Agency has recognized the medical benefits of a natural compound...</span><br><br>\n\n\n\n            And this patent also means what while CBD is currently available to the general public and at incredibly affordable prices...<br><br>\n\n\n\n            That may not be the case for long. <br><br>\n\n\n\n            And that brings us to your second question...</p>\n\n\n\n            <h2 class=\"centerheading\">\"Where can I find the best from of CBD oil right away?\"... So you can begin experiencing its hundreds of benefits immediately? </h2>\n\n\n\n            <p>I was asking myself the same thing when I first started hearing about CBD all over the news...</p>\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            <p>And I did have a bit of a leg-up here...<br><br>\n\n\n\n            Because one thing I didn’t mention already is that besides being an active Pastor in my church...<br><br>\n\n\n\n            <span class=\"boldtext\">I’ve also been a manufacturer of premium, all natural health supplements for the better part of a decade.</span> <br><br>\n\n\n\n            <span class=\"boldtext\"><u>Using the remedies that God’s given us through nature, to help us all live and feel better.</u></span></p>\n\n\n\n            <p>This means I’ve got great relationships with health experts all over the world...<br><br>\n\n\n\n            Which was extremely helpful as I set out to find the best form of CBD available today.<br><br>\n\n\n\n            This urgency behind my search was also a bit personal, by the way.</p>\n\n\n\n            <p class=\"boldtext\">My father-in-law (who is also in the church) had suffered from intense joint pain for as long as I’ve known him...</p>\n\n\n\n            <p>So I wanted to something that would make him feel better too...<br><br>\n\n\n\n            So that he could reclaim his life.</p>\n\n\n\n            <h2 class=\"centerheading\">I wanted him to be able to join me, my wife, and our four young children when we went on family hikes...</h2>\n\n\n\n            <h2 class=\"centerheading\">So that he could skip along with his grandsons and granddaughters, climb up rocks with them, and basically be a big kid...</h2>\n\n\n\n            <h2 class=\"centerheading\">And do all of it without wincing in pain every 5 minutes....</h2>\n\n\n\n            <p>Or feeling like he needed to lay down and rest as soon as we got home.</p>\n\n\n\n            <p class=\"boldtext\">So I began ordering CBD products from everyone in the industry I knew of...<br><br>\n\n\n\n            And the great news was that they WORKED!<br><br>\n\n\n\n            <u>Within a matter of days my father-in-law’s pain levels were lower than they’d been in three decades...</u></p>\n\n\n\n            <p>While personally I noticed I was sleeping better...<br><br>\n\n\n\n            Feeling calmer and more focused....<br><br>\n\n\n\n            And I even noticed my blood pressure went down.<br><br>\n\n\n\n             \n\n\n\n            So that was the good part...</p>\n\n\n\n            <h2 class=\"centerheading\">But I was also frustrated to find out that almost everyone selling CBD oil did it in liquid form...</h2>\n\n\n\n            <p>Where you were responsible for putting several drops underneath your tongue. </p>\n\n\n\n            <p class=\"boldtext\">Not only does this taste nasty...<br><br>\n\n\n\n            It also makes it hard to get the dose right, which is very frustrating.</p>\n\n\n\n            <p>So I went to work...<br><br>\n\n\n\n            Hitting the lab, and drawing on all of my years as an expert in the health supplement space.</p>\n\n\n\n            <h2 class=\"centerheading\">Finally, what I came up with was a way to capture the power of CBD oil inside of a small, liquid gel capsule.</h2>\n\n\n\n            <p>Each capsule contains 10mg of 100% Pure Quality CBD Oil, which is more than enough for most folks...</p>\n\n\n\n            <p class=\"boldtext\">And each capsule is about the size of a small BB – which makes it very easy to swallow.<br><br>\n\n\n\n            <u>I’m telling you, these gel capsules have been a blessing for so many folks...</u></p>\n\n\n\n            <p>And I’m proud that because of my experience and know-how in this industry...</p>\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            <h2 class=\"centerheading\">I’m one of the only people on the planet who can make these gel caps. </h2>\n\n\n\n            <p>Plus once I’d figured all of this out...<br><br>\n\n\n\n            I even went a step further...</p>\n\n\n\n            <p class=\"boldtext\">And added 490 milligrams of pure hemp oil into each gel capsule too.</p>\n\n\n\n            <p>You see while CBD is the most powerful cannabinoid of all...<br><br>\n\n\n\n            Hemp oil has hundreds of additional and amazing benefits. </p>\n\n\n\n            <h2 class=\"centerheading\">It actually has the highest amount of Omegas 3, 6, and 9 of any plant as well...</h2>\n\n\n\n            <p class=\"boldtext\">Which makes it great for your heart, your joints, and your brain.<br><br>\n\n\n\n            <u>And because these crucial Omegas are coming from a plant, rather than a fish...</u><br><br>\n\n\n\n            <u>With Hemp Oil you don’t have to worry about mercury, or that fishy taste afterwards.</u> </p>\n\n\n\n            <h2 class=\"centerheading\"><u>I’m calling this product Green Relief...</u><br><br>\n\n\n\n            It’s made right here in the United States, in an FDA Compliant Facility...</h2>\n\n\n\n            <p class=\"boldtext\">And you have my word that it’s the best, most ultra-grade form of CBD Oil that you can find on the market.</p>\n\n\n\n            <p>So now let me tell you how you can get your very own supply of Green Relief today...<br><br>\n\n\n\n            So that you can begin to free yourself from discomfort, aches, and pain within a few short days.</p>\n\n\n\n            <p class=\"boldtext\">Originally my plan was to retail Green Relief for $149 a bottle, which is extremely reasonable in my opinion.</p>\n\n\n\n            <p>After all once you start using this all-natural breakthrough...<br><br>\n\n\n\n            The relief you get could be just as powerful as if you were using a prescription opiate painkiller...</p>\n\n\n\n            <p class=\"boldtext\">But with Green Relief there are zero of the side effects, and it’s not habit forming. <br><br>\n\n\n\n            <u>In fact, if anything has hundreds of side-benefits...</u></p>\n\n\n\n            <p>Like better sleep, better mood, lower blood pressure, a healthier immune system, anti-cancer properties,

ask me...<br /><br />\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            That way you can make your investment in Green Relief today with 100% peace-of-mind. \n\n\n\n            </p>-->\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            <!--<p class=\"boldtext\">Question 1: So how exactly does CBD oil make my pain go away again?</p>\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            <p>So remember that CBD stands for cannabidiol...<br /><br />\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            And it’s the most important cannabinoid in the Endocannabinoid System.<br /><br />\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            The Endocannabinoid System is what controls all of your hormones in your body...<br /><br />\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            And this includes Enkephalin...<br /><br />\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            Which is the hormone that experts call the body’s “natural painkiller.”<br /><br /> \n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            In fact, Enkephalin is so powerful that most commercial opiates are based off of it...<br /><br />\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            But what CBD does is regulate the release of Enkephalin into your system naturally...<br /><br />\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            So that you get extremely powerful and effective pain relief...<br /><br />\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            Without any fear of addiction, or damage to your body.</p>\n\n\n\n

behind CBD is staggering...<br /><br />\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            And even the government has patented this miracle for a variety of uses...<br /><br />\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            Saying that it:<br /><br />\n\n\n\n            </p>\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            <ul class=\"tick\">\n\n\n\n            <li>Protects the brain and supports healthy blood and oxygen flow...</li>\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            <li>Acts as a neuroprotectant that can limit damage in cases of stroke or trauma, and treat degenerative diseases including dementia...</li>\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            <li>Protects the cells of the nervous system and brain...</li>\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            <li>Has an anti-anxiety effect...</li>\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            <li>Supports the nutritional health of aging bodies...</li>\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            <li>Can help with the treatment of glaucoma...</li>\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            <li>Can act as an anti-epileptic and anti-seizure...</li>\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            </ul>\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            <p>So while all commercial and pharmaceutical pain-killers have bad side effects, CBD actually only has good side BENEFITS. And since it’s all-natural and non-habit forming, it’s impossible to “take too much”.</p>-->\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            <!--<p class=\"boldtext\">Question 3: Are you 100% Positive that CBD Won’t Make Me “High?”</p>\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            <p>Yes.<br/><br/>\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            It’s scientifically impossible to get “high” off of CBD and here’s why...<br/><br/>\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            First of all, the CBD in Green Relief comes from industrial hemp, not cannabis...<br/><br/>\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            Which is why it’s legal in all 50 states.<br/><br/>\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            Secondly, it’s the THC in cannabis that gets people high...<br/><br/>\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            But CBD is simply an ultra-healthy compound found within the same plants...<br/><br/>\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            It has zero psychoactive effects on you whatsoever.</p>-->\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n

you place your order, my team will go to work shipping it out to you.<br/><br/> \n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            From there it’ll just take 3-5 business days...<br/><br/>\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            And once you start using Green Relief...<br/><br/>\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            You could start feeling relief in as little as 30 minutes!</p>-->\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            <!--<p class=\"boldtext\">Question 5: How much Green Relief should I take each day?</p>\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            <p>So each bottle comes with thirty 10mg liquid gel capsules.<br/><br/>\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            I’d say you simply start with one, allow 30-60 minutes, and see how you feel.<br/><br/>\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            If you’re pain is really severe, you simply take as many additional gel capsules as you need each day...<br/><br/>\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            Because unlike Advil or other painkillers, Green Relief is 100% natural and there are no dangerous side-effects or harm to your liver or body.<br/><br/>\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            Plus if you do decide to take several capsules a day...<br/><br/>\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            I’ve made it very affordable to do so by offering my 6 bottle discount.</p>-->\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n

suffer from severe pain, and think that it might take more than one capsule a day of Green Relief to get the ultimate relief you need...<br/><br/>\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            You simply order 6 bottles on the checkout page...<br/><br/>\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            And you get them at a rate of just $49/bottle...<br/><br/>\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            Which is a huge savings of $100/bottle off the normal retail price.<br/><br/>\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            This is also a great option if you want to order for family and friends, or want to stock up in case the government bans CBD again...<br/><br/>\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            And you’ll be 100% protected when you do this because your order comes with my 180 Day, 100% Money Back

    Big medicine and the pharmaceutical industries rush to get it banned immediately.<br/><br/>\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            I think there’s a very real danger this happens with CBD

they could always decide they want to use it as a source of revenue...<br/><br/>\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            And ban others from providing it to the public...<br/><br/>\n\n\n\n
