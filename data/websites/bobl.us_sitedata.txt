It is a responsibility of the MEMBER to pull the latest links on a regular  basis in order to stay synchronized with the Unicorn Referral Program.</p><p>\n<strong>(d)&nbsp;Marketing  Materials:</strong>&nbsp;Unicorn will  make available to MEMBER Unicorn’s approved  logos (collectively the “Unicorn Logos”),  web buttons, text links, banners, videos etc. designed by Unicorn to promote the various Unicorn websites. From time to time Unicorn may modify, supplement, or  give MEMBER new Marketing Materials, at Unicorn’s  sole discretion. MEMBER shall be solely responsible for using and  integrating (and for all costs related thereto) the Unicorn Links and the Marketing Materials in accordance with the  terms of this Agreement.&nbsp;You are directly responsible for any claims you make  that are not already made publically by Unicorn in the approved Marketing  Materials. Any claims made by MEMBER that are false, misleading, or do not correspond  with the terms and conditions of Unicorn could possibly lead to termination of  MEMBER account and further action as required.</p><p>\n<strong>(e) Press  Releases: </strong>MEMBER shall reasonably  cooperate in Unicorn’s marketing and public relations activities to promote the  Unicorn websites (provided that such cooperation shall not result in any  out-of-pocket cost or unreasonable internal administrative cost to MEMBER). Such  activities may include, without limitation, issuing approved press releases  announcing Unicorn websites and services.&nbsp;MEMBER shall not (i) issue a  press release or other public announcement regarding this Agreement or the  matters addressed herein or (ii) use the name, logo, trademark, or other  service mark, in each instance without first obtaining Unicorn’s prior written  consent. You will not misrepresent or embellish the relationship between Unicorn  and you (including by expressing or implying that Unicorn supports, sponsors,  endorses, or contributes to any charity or other cause), or expressing or imply  any relationship or affiliation between Unicorn and you or any other person or  entity except as expressly permitted by this Agreement.&nbsp;</p><p>\n<strong>(f)&nbsp;Grant  of License:</strong>&nbsp; Unicorn hereby  grants to MEMBER, a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable  license for the Term of the Agreement (the “License”) to (i) display,  reproduce, distribute and transmit in digital form the Marketing Materials of Unicorn for the sole purpose of  promoting the Unicorn websites,  (ii) publish the Free Unicorn Materials  in email solicitations from MEMBER to his/her mailing list whereby MEMBER  promotes, in whole or in part, the Unicorn  websites, and (iii) link or deep-link from the MEMBER’S own or third  party’s websites and/or, if applicable, from emails to Unicorn websites. <strong>MEMBER  acknowledges that Unicorn has a  strict ZERO SPAM POLICY. </strong>Using any form of spam to promote Unicorn websites will lead to  immediate termination of this agreement.</p><p>\n<strong>(g)&nbsp;Scope  of License:</strong>&nbsp;MEMBER shall not use any of the Marketing Materials for  any purpose other than promoting Unicorn  websites in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or as approved  in writing by Unicorn. The exact  manner of placement of, and the size and location of, the Unicorn Marketing Materials on the  MEMBER'S websites shall be as reasonably determined by MEMBER; provided,  however, that MEMBER shall not (i) use, copy or format any of the Marketing  Materials (A) in any illegal, libelous, defamatory or other tortuous or  improper manner, or (B) on any website that promotes pornography, gambling, or  any illegal activity; or (ii) alter, edit, translate, create derivative works  of or otherwise modify any of the Marketing Materials unless Unicorn expressly approves thereof in  writing.&nbsp; </p><p>\n<strong>2.&nbsp;USE  OF </strong><strong>UNICORN </strong></p><p>\n<strong>(a) Account Personalization and Use:</strong></p><p>\n<strong>i. Business Accounts:</strong> Business accounts  are only applicable in PerfectPages (<a href=\"//www.perfectpag.es\">www.perfectpag.es</a>) or where otherwise authorized in Unicorn and separate  terms apply. Having a business account does not constitute having a MEMBER  account and a separate registration is required to have both types of accounts.  If a business also signs up for a MEMBER account, all MEMBER terms apply just  like any other MEMBER Account.</p><p>\n<strong>ii. Trademark: </strong>We reserve the right to  reclaim usernames without liability to you, on behalf of businesses or  individuals that hold legal claim or trademark on those usernames. Accounts  using business names and/or logos to mislead others may be suspended or  terminated.</p><p>\n<strong>iii. Profile Images: </strong>You may not use any  hateful, pornographic, or excessively violent media in your profile image. When  Content crosses the line into gratuitous images, Unicorn may ask that you  remove the Content out of respect.</p><p>\n<strong>iv. Private information: </strong>You may not  publish or post other people's private and confidential information, such as  credit card numbers, street address, or Social Security/National Identity  numbers, without their express authorization and written permission.  Additionally, you may not post intimate photos or videos that were taken or  distributed without the subject's consent. </p><p>\n<strong>v. Impersonation: </strong>You may not  impersonate others through the Service in a manner that is intended to or does  mislead, confuse, or deceive others. Parody and tribute accounts must be  clearly stated and may be subject to additional terms and conditions based on  the specific cases and instances where it applies.</p><p>\n<strong>vi. Account Privacy and Private Use: </strong>While  specifically identifiable account information is private, MEMBER name, profile  photo, and general country location may be publically displayed on Unicorn  websites. If MEMBER wishes to have a more private experience in Unicorn, they  must select those privacy options within their profile on Unicorn websites.  Members wishing to post Content privately must use the private posting and message  options to do so. Just because Content is private does not exempt MEMBER from  following all terms, privacy, and general ethical conduct as a MEMBER of Unicorn. <strong></strong></p><p>\n<strong>vii. Violent threats (direct or indirect): </strong>You  may not promote violence or make threats of violence, including threatening or  promoting terrorism.</p><p>\n<strong>viii. Harassment: </strong>You may not incite or  engage in the targeted abuse or harassment of others. We may consider some of  the following factors when evaluating abusive behavior including but not  limited to:</p><p>\n<strong>If a primary purpose of the reported  MEMBER account is to harass or send abusive messages to others; if the reported  behavior includes threats; if the reported behavior is one-sided; if the  reported MEMBER account is inciting others to harass another MEMBER account;  and if the reported MEMBER account is sending harassing messages to a MEMBER  account from multiple accounts.</strong></p><p>\n<strong>ix. Hateful conduct: </strong>You may not promote  violence against or directly attack or threaten other people on any basis  including, but not limited to race, national origin, ethnicity, gender, sexual  orientation, religious affiliation, gender identity, age, disease, or  disability. We also do not allow accounts whose primary purpose is inciting  harm towards others.</p>\n      <h3>(b)  Content:</h3>\n      <h3>i. Member-Generated Content: Unicorn may delete any Content  that in the sole judgment of Unicorn violates this Agreement or which may be  offensive, illegal or violate the rights, harms, or threatens the safety of any  person. Unicorn assumes no responsibility for monitoring Unicorn for inappropriate  Content or conduct. On various Unicorn websites, Unicorn provides users with  tools to remove or flag any Content they personally feel is inappropriate as  well. </h3>\n      <p><strong>ii. Adult and Graphic Content: </strong>Unicorn does  not allow any forms of graphic or adult Content unless it is posted in appropriate  age-restricted areas of Unicorn. In some areas of Unicorn, Content is marked as  “Adult” and is viewable by members over 18 years of age and will also be restricted  in locations where the Content is restricted locally by law. If you wish to  upload or share adult Content or any other graphic image on your account, it  must be posted in the appropriate age-restricted areas. When Content crosses  the line into extremely gratuitous images, as interpreted and judged by the Unicorn  Support Team based on general user feedback, Unicorn may ask that you remove  the Content out of respect.</p><p>\n        <strong>iii. Content Monitoring: </strong>If at any time Unicorn chooses, in its  sole discretion, to monitor Unicorn websites, then Unicorn nonetheless assumes no responsibility for the Content,  no obligation to modify or remove any inappropriate Content, and no  responsibility for the conduct of the member submitting any such Content. You are solely responsible for your use of the Services, for  any Content you upload or post to the Services, and for any consequences  thereof. </p><p>\n        <strong>iv. Content Submissions: </strong>Most Content  you upload, submit, post, or display through Unicorn is public by default  unless posted via private options provided by Unicorn and will be able to be  viewed by other members and through third party services and websites. Unicorn does not endorse  and has no control over the Content. Content is not reviewed by Unicorn prior to MEMBER uploading, posting, or sharing and does  not necessarily reflect the opinions or policies of Unicorn.

Sharing Content Across Social Media  Websites: </strong>Unicorn may provide links and methods to share Content across  various other social media networks and websites outside of Unicorn; it is the MEMBER'S  responsibility to follow all terms and privacy policies on those other  websites. Unicorn assumes no responsibility for members using and posting Content  or the Content itself shared or posted on other social websites from any  Unicorn website.</p><p>\n        <strong>vi. Warranty and Content Ownership:</strong> Unicorn  makes  no warranties, express, or implied, as to the Content or to the accuracy and  reliability of the Content or any material or information that you transmit to  other members through Unicorn. Unicorn claims no ownership of Content that is posted or  uploaded by its members. All intellectual copyrights of the original owners  remain with them.
