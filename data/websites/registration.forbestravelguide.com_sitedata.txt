Here are some examples of the ways in which we may collect and store\n      your personally identifiable information through our websites:\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <p>\n          we may collect your email address, first and last name, and zip code, if you sign up for an online newsletter;\n        </p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <p>\n          we may collect your email address if you contact us with a question;\n        </p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <p>\n          we may collect your first and last name, date of birth, and email address if you choose to participate in a\n          contest or sweepstakes; and\n        </p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <p>\n          we may collect your first and last name, your address, and your credit card and billing information to enable you\n          to make a purchase.\n        </p>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>\n      \"Non-personally identifiable information\" can be technical information or it can be demographic information, such as\n      your age, gender, or interests. Non-personally identifiable information does not identify you personally. If you do\n      provide us with non-personally identifiable information, we may use it for the purposes described in this Privacy\n      Policy or where it is collected, or any other legal purpose.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Here are some examples of the ways in which we may collect and store your non-personally identifiable information\n      through our websites, and how we use such information:\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <p>\n          Internet Protocol (IP) address. Your \"IP address\" is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know\n          where to send you data, such as the screens and pages of our websites that you view. We use this information to\n          deliver our screens and pages to you upon request, to tailor our websites to the interests of you and our other\n          visitors, and to measure traffic to and within our websites.\n        </p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <p>\n          Cookie. A \"cookie\" is a small text file that may be used to collect information about your activity on our\n          websites. For example, when you visit a screen or page on our websites, a cookie is placed on your machine (if you\n          or your browser accept the cookie). This cookie may then be read by screen or pages on our websites. You may\n          configure your browser to notify you or to reject and block cookies, but if you do, you may not have access to\n          some areas of our websites, or to the personalized features of our websites.\n        </p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <p>\n          Web Beacon. A \"web beacon\", \"clear gif\", \"web bug\", or \"pixel tag\" is a tiny graphic file with a unique\n          identifier, that is similar in function to a cookie, but allows us to count the number of users that have visited\n          certain pages or screens of our websites, and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising\n          campaigns. When used in HTML-formatted email messages, web beacons can tell the sender whether and when the email\n          has been opened. In contrast to cookies, which may be stored on your computer's hard drive, web beacons are\n          typically embedded invisibly on pages or screens.\n        </p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <p>\n          Demographic Information. \"Demographic information\" may be your gender, age, zip code, and interests. We may\n          collect such information about your through our websites and use it to provide you with personalized services and\n          to analyze trends to ensure that our websites and services and the information on them is targeted to meet your\n          needs. Please note that we also consider aggregated information, which is not personally identifiable, to be\n          non-personally identifiable information.\n        </p>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>\n      If you encounter a screen or page that requests information you do not want to share with us, do not enter the\n      information and do not proceed with that screen or page.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      <b>C.

In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a\n      request by a California customer, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom personal\n      information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information\n      that were disclosed.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and\n      discloses to the public (in its privacy policy ) a policy of not disclosing customer's personal information to third\n      parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long\n      as the business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the\n      customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free means to exercise\n      that right.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      As stated in our Privacy Policy, we do not share information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes\n      unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure -- typically by opting-in to receive information from a third party.\n      To prevent disclosure of your personal information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt-in to such\n      use when you provide personal information on our website. Please note that whenever you opt-in to receive future\n      communications from a third party, your information will be subject to the third-party's privacy policies and\n      practices. If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact\n      the third party directly, as we have no control over how third parties use information.
