My name is Virgil Dupras, I live in Qu√©bec, Canada. I'm a software developer and have been\nfor quite a while. The vocation of this website changed a lot over the years and I think that the\nbest \"about\" section would be a short history of it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hardcoded.net/archive2001\">In 2001</a>, I started this website to host my software, Mp3 Filter (initially written\nin <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarcadero_Delphi\">Delphi</a> and now called <a href=\"https://www.hardcoded.net/dupeguru_me/\">dupeGuru ME</a>) which I soon started to sell as shareware.\nThings gradually went for the better and, <a href=\"https://www.hardcoded.net/archive2004\">in 2004</a>, I could leave my day job to work\nexclusively on my own software.</p>\n<p>It's also in 2004 that I discover <a href=\"http://www.python.org\">Python</a> which became (and still is) my favorite\nprogramming language. I then rewrite my applications in it. Initially, the GUI layer was kept in\nDelphi and worked only in Windows, but <a href=\"https://www.hardcoded.net/archive2006\">in 2006</a>, wanting to support Mac OS X, I started\ndoing something I called \"<a href=\"https://www.hardcoded.net/articles/cross-toolkit-software\">cross-toolkit development</a>\" which allowed me to support\nmultiple platforms without ending up with an ugly, non-native looking app that <a href=\"http://www.wxwidgets.org/\">wxWidgets</a> or\n<a href=\"http://qt-project.org/\">Qt</a> gave me on OS X.</p>\n<p>Supporting Mac OS X was the beginning of real money coming in. That initially startled me because,\nafter all, Mac has a much lower market share than Windows. I understood that Mac users had more\nmoney and, more importantly, had a different culture than Windows users: they were used to pay for\ntheir software. I started really liking Mac.</p>\n<p>All this time and until <a href=\"https://www.hardcoded.net/archive2009\">2009</a>, I'm doing proprietary software. I began my career thinking\nthat free (as in speech) software developers were silly because they were giving their \"property\"\naway, all for nothing. However, over time, my understanding of intellectual property evolved and in\n2009, I make a leap to <a href=\"https://www.hardcoded.net/articles/going_open_source\">try to reconcile</a> the income source of shareware with the\nfreedom of open source.</p>\n<p>At the time, I feared a collapse of my revenue, which never happened, but I wasn't satisfied with my\nsolution because it wasn't really open source and didn't make total sense, in retrospective. A year\nlater, I leap again and <a href=\"https://www.hardcoded.net/articles/free-as-in-speech-fair-as-in-trade\">start fairware</a>, which this time is really open source.</p>\n<p>Once again, the feared collapse of revenu never happens and, quite happily, I sail through\ndevelopment having finally reconciled software freedom and revenue... until <a href=\"https://www.hardcoded.net/archive2012\">2012</a>.</p>\n<p>In 10 years, I had developed a few applications, but only one ever worked commercially, dupeGuru.\ndupeGuru has been very fun to work on, but after this much time, one grows tired of developing the\nsame application. In fact, I grew tired of \"shareware type\" software development altogether. So, I\ntook a job at a local <a href=\"http://www.savoirfairelinux.com/en/\">free software consultant firm</a> and I've been working there since then.\nIt's a lot of fun so far.</p>\n<p>I still maintain HS applications, but I greatly reduced their development pace. Because fairware\nis all about selling development time instead of granting usage permission to intellectual property,\nit doesn't make sense collecting money for that software, which is why I have been\n<a href=\"https://www.hardcoded.net/articles/phasing-out-fairware\">phasing it out</a>.</p>\n<p>Because my interest for developing HS apps as actively as in the past is waning, and because it\nsaddens me to think that these projects could eventually become unmaintained, I'm currently in the\nprocess of trying to <a href=\"https://www.hardcoded.net/contribute\">attract new developers</a> to those projects. Am I doing it right?\nI don't know, but I'm very interested in hearing what you have to say about that.</p>\n<h2>Latest News</h2>\n\n    <ul class=\"nav nav-pills spacebelow\">\n\t\t\n            <li class=\"active\"><a href=\"#\">Latest</a></li>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n                <li><a href=\"archive2016\">2016</a></li>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n                <li><a href=\"archive2015\">2015</a></li>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n                <li><a href=\"archive2014\">2014</a></li>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n                <li><a href=\"archive2013\">2013</a></li>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n                <li><a href=\"archive2012\">2012</a></li>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n                <li><a href=\"archive2011\">2011</a></li>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n                <li><a href=\"archive2010\">2010</a></li>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n                <li><a href=\"archive2009\">2009</a></li>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n                <li><a href=\"archive2008\">2008</a></li>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n                <li><a href=\"archive2007\">2007</a></li>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n                <li><a href=\"archive2006\">2006</a></li>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n                <li><a href=\"archive2005\">2005</a></li>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n                <li><a href=\"archive2004\">2004</a></li>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n                <li><a href=\"archive2003\">2003</a></li>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n                <li><a href=\"archive2002\">2002</a></li>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n                <li><a href=\"archive2001\">2001</a></li>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n    </ul>\n\t\n        <div class=\"panel panel-primary\">\n            <div class=\"panel-heading\"><h3 class=\"panel-title\">\n\t\t    2016-11-24 -- <b>dupeGuru 4.0.3 released</b>\n\t\t    (<a name=\"2016-11-24\" href=\"http://www.hardcoded.net/archive2016#2016-11-24\">link</a>)\n            </h3></div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<ul>\n<li>Add new picture cache backend: shelve</li>\n<li>Make shelve picture cache backend the active one on MacOS to fix #394 more\n  elegantly.

I upgraded it to Sierra.\nSince the upgrade, my old version of VMWare Fusion doesn't work anymore and I will not pay for\nanother upgrade.</p>\n<p>I used Fusion to ensure that builds I create work in older MacOS versions. I can't do that\nanymore. New maintainers are needed.</p>\n<p>The big problem with dupeGuru and moneyGuru is that their UI is generated by xibless, which is\na library I've created to get rid of XCode which I dislike. This library is a lot of effort to\nmaintain and is a lot of effort, for a potential contributor, to discover how it works. It also\nhas many unfixed glitches.</p>\n<p>With hindsight, I realize this was a mistake and I should have suffered XCode like everyone\nelse instead. If, as a potential maintainer, you're put off by the whole xibless thing, you\nshould know that you have my blessing to scrap it all. It shouldn't be all that hard because\ndupeGuru was still a good old XCode project at tag \"se3.5.0\" and moneyGuru at tag \"2.5.5\". It\nshould only be a matter of resurrecting the old code, modernize it and re-apply UI changes\nfrom recent versions.</p>\n\t    </div>\n        </div>\n\t\n        <div class=\"panel panel-primary\">\n            <div class=\"panel-heading\"><h3 class=\"panel-title\">\n\t\t    2016-10-09 -- <b>dupeGuru 4.0.2 released</b>\n\t\t    (<a name=\"2016-10-09\" href=\"http://www.hardcoded.net/archive2016#2016-10-09\">link</a>)\n            </h3></div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<ul>\n<li>Fix systematic crash in Picture Mode under MacOS Sierra. <a href=\"https://github.com/hsoft/dupeguru/issues/394\">#394</a></li>\n<li>No change for Linux.
