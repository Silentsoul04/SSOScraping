This privacy statement provides notice of our information collection practices and of the ways in which your information may be used. This policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically to review this information. </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    <b>A. Personally-Identifiable Information:</b><br>\n                    The Spanish Method typically receives specific data about its website visitors only when such information is provided voluntarily, such as when our visitors request information, purchase or enroll for services, open a customer support inquiry ticket, provide resume information for employment opportunities, or send us e-mail. Of course, some of these activities require that you give us information, such as when you make a purchase, use a credit card to pay for services, submit your resume, or request certain types of information. When you provide personally- identifiable information to The Spanish Method through one of our websites, it will be used to fulfill your specific request. In most cases, you will be given the opportunity to select whether you do, or do not, want The Spanish Method to use this information for additional purposes. You may also request that The Spanish Method not use your information by sending an e-mail to: <u>support@The Spanish Method</u> , however, The Spanish Method reserves the right, in its discretion, to send you bulletins and other important information about your The Spanish Method services. Absent any instructions from you, The Spanish Method may use information you provide to inform you about additional services and products offered by the The Spanish Method family of companies, The Spanish Method authorized agents, and other goods and services providers with whom The Spanish Method has relationships and whose offerings might be of interest to you. The Spanish Method will not, however, sell or trade your personally-identifiable information unless we are authorized or legally required to do so, or in the case of imminent physical harm to the visitor or others. On those The Spanish Method sites where you may provide The Spanish Method with credit card or other ordering information via the web, The Spanish Method protects and secures this information by employing commercially customary web- based security and encryption protocols, examples of which include Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Secure Electronic Transaction (SET). On those sites where you voluntarily offer any feedback, data, answers, questions, comments, suggestions, ideas or the like, The Spanish Method will treat that portion of the information as non-confidential and nonproprietary and, except as otherwise expressed in this privacy statement, The Spanish Method assumes no obligation to protect such information from disclosure. \n                </p>\n\n                <p>Examples in these materials are not to be taken as a promise or guarantee of earnings. Earning potential is entirely dependent on the person using our product, ideas, techniques and the effort put forth. We do not purport this as a \"get rich scheme\", and nor should you view it as such. </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    <b>B. Non Personally-Identifiable (Generic) Information:</b><br>\n                    In general, The Spanish Method gathers some generic information automatically. Generic information does not reveal the identity of the visitor. It usually includes information about the Internet address assigned to your computer, the number and frequency of visitors, and the The Spanish Method sites visited. The Spanish Method gathers this information for the limited purpose of determining customer service and website needs. We accomplish this by using certain technologies, including \"cookies\" (a technology that can be used to provide the visitor with tailored information about The Spanish Method services). The Spanish Method does not combine information collected in this way with any personally-identifiable information. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie and you can refuse it. \n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    <b>C.
