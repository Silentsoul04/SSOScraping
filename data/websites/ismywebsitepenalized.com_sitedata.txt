Our goal is simple - to perform a quick and secure search engine penalty test and give you a clear answer about whether or not your website is penalized by Google search engine.</p>\n\n<p class=\"b\">How does it work?</p>\n\n<p>It's very simple. All you have to do is to enter website name (for example: ismywebsitepenalized.com, sub.domain.com, etc.) and submit the form. The magic happens behind the scenes where some complex mathematical and statistical analysis takes place. Once all calculations are completed, the results are displayed on the screen.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to examining search engine positions, this tool checks if the \"Robots\" META tag and the robots.txt file are valid and are properly implemented on the tested website.</p>\n\n<p class=\"b\">How reliable are the results?</p>\n\n<p>We believe the results provided by IsMyWebsitePenalized are as close to the true answer as you can get, even though the real answer is impossible to find out. The ultimate <i>Yes</i>/<i>No</i> answer (especially related to algorithmic penalties) may only be known to the specific search engine algorithms, but our tool (updated every 24 hrs) may not be very far behind them.</p>\n\n<p>Please note the results of this tool are conservative and a tested site will not usually appear as penalized in case of unfavorable algorithmic assessments that may have been applied to it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"b\">What is the difference between PENALIZED or DEFINITELY PENALIZED?</p>\n\n<p>The difference is small but may have significant implications. In general, PENALIZED means that one of the two crucial search engine query logs indicate that your website is penalized. If data from both of the crucial queries are true then the result appears as DEFINITELY PENALIZED.</p>\n\n<p><i>Important</i>: Parked domains, redirected domains, or new websites (launched less than 2 months ago) will almost always appear as PENALIZED or DEFINITELY PENALIZED.</p>\n\n<p class=\"b\">What if the result is HARD TO TELL?</p>\n\n<p>HARD TO TELL results are usually a good sign to a website owner because they are preventable and easy to fix. They are typically related to incorrect use of the \"Robots\" META tag or the robots.txt file. Once the issues are resolved, search engine rankings of the affected websites almost always improve back to normal without any other extra effort.</p>\n\n<p class=\"b\">What are the most common technical mistakes related to websites in relation to SEO work?</p>\n\n<p>- Improper use of the \"Robots\" META tag. For example, using the NOINDEX tag on pages intended to be indexed.</p>\n\n<p>- Improper use of the robots.txt file. For example, using of the 'disallow: /' directive for content intended to be accessed by search engine robots.</p>\n\n<p>- Search engine indexing issues caused by creating multiple URLs pointing to the same page/content or incorrect use of the Canonical Tag. For example, publishing the same content on different pages and linking to both the index page and root domain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"b\">What are possible types of search engine penalties?</p>\n\n<p>There are two of the most common penalties: <i>manual</i> and <i>algorithmic</i>. They can be triggered by: spam and search engine manipulation (buying or selling links; pointing unnatural links to your website; participating in link schemes; over-optimization of keywords), publishing unoriginal / low-quality content, or hosting malware / phishing content. It is possible that a manual penalty may be the result of a negative SEO attack. Note that the majority of algorithmic penalties aren't in fact penalties but an algorithm update.</p>\n\n<p class=\"b\">Is there a quick and easy way to lift a search engine penalty and improve the rankings of my website?</p>\n\n<p>Everything is possible, but the recovery operation is almost always slow and difficult. If you or your webmaster have willingly (or unwillingly) violated the search engine Terms and your website is now banned or penalized, you have to be prepared for a long-term process to repair the damage. There are a few situations, usually related to manual penalties, when the process can be sped up and be almost always successful, but it all depends on who did the damage and how severe the penalty is.</p>\n\n<p>Our best and always-relevant advice to all website owners is: do not spam, do not buy or sell links, do not participate in link schemes, do not engage in dishonest Internet marketing practices, produce good and original content, try to build your own brand, and provide the best experience to your website visitors.</p>\n\n<p>If you don't have time, expertise, or resources to market your website, you will be much better off focusing your energy on creating remarkable content rather than trying to actively \"promote\" your online business.</p>\n\n<p class=\"b\">Can you help my website recover from a search engine penalty?</p>\n\n<p>If the outcome of the search engine penalty test is PENALIZED or DEFINITELY PENALIZED, you may contact us and we may be able to help. We will reply to your inquiry only if we determine that you haven't severely and willingly violated Google's Terms and Guidelines.</p>\n\n<p>If you believe your website has been attacked by your competitors, you may use the URLtoDomain.com tool to disavow irrelevant links.</p>\n<br>\n<h2>TERMS-AND-PRIVACY</h2>\n<br>\n<p>- The search engine penalty test result is provided for information purposes only and may not be complete or accurate.
