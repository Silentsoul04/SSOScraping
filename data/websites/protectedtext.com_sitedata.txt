The idea is that we don't have to know the password; we just have to make sure that the password is correct - and one way to check that is to try decrypting some well-known text using the provided password. The \"well-known\" text we're using is the URL of the current site (which is different, but known, for each site).\n                                    <br>\n                                    Once a user creates the password, we store the encrypted URL, and each time the password needs to be tested, we just try decrypting the encrypted URL. If we get the expected URL, we try using the same password for decrypting the whole site (it's possible -- but very unlikely -- that two different passwords correctly decrypt the same URL, but using that wrong password for decrypting everything else will result in gibberish).\n                                </p>\n                            </li>\n                            <li>\n                                <p class=\"remove-bottom faq-question\"> <span class=\"bold-span\">Q:</span> How does overwrite protection work? </p>\n                                <p class=\"faq-answer\"> <span class=\"bold-span\">A:</span>\n                                    Overwrite protection prevents you from saving any changes if text was changed in the meantime.

Even if you knew the server code, you couldn't confirm whether that unmodified code was running or if it was replaced by something else. In other words: whenever a server's code is responsible for providing security, you have to trust whoever runs it.\n                                </p>\n                            </li>\n                            <li>\n                                <p class=\"remove-bottom faq-question\"> <span class=\"bold-span\">Q:</span> How long do you keep sites on your servers?
