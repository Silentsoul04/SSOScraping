The office is currently involved in a large number of projects throughout Europe, North America, Asia and the Middle East. BIG’s architecture emerges out of a careful analysis of how contemporary life constantly evolves and changes. Not least due to the influence from multicultural exchange, global economical flows and communication technologies that all together require new ways of architectural and urban organization. We believe that in order to deal with today’s challenges, architecture can profitably move into a field that has been largely unexplored. A pragmatic utopian architecture that steers clear of the petrifying pragmatism of boring boxes and the naïve utopian ideas of digital formalism. Like a form of programmatic alchemy we create architecture by mixing conventional ingredients such as living, leisure, working, parking and shopping. By hitting the fertile overlap between pragmatic and utopia, we architects once again find the freedom to change the surface of our planet, to better fit contemporary life forms.</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>    \n<div>\n        <div class=\"picture\" style=\"height:602px\">\n    <a href=\"#\">\n        <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"http://cdn.big.dk/images/about/13_partners-oct-2016-retouched-landscape-with-daniel_frontend.jpg\" src=\"/layouts/default/css/images/blank.gif\" width=\"800px\" height=\"602px\">\n    </a>\n    </div>\n        <div>\n                <h3>\n            <a href=\"#\">\n                BIG PARTNERS            </a>\n        </h3>\n                <div>\n            <p>\n\tBIG is led by 12 partners – Bjarke Ingels, Sheela Maini Søgaard, Finn Nørkjær, Thomas Christoffersen, Kai-Uwe Bergmann, Andreas Klok Pedersen, David Zahle, Jakob Lange, Beat Schenk, Daniel Sundlin, Brian Yang and Jakob Sand.

It is one of the youngest cities in America – and perhaps right now one of the most vibrant and dynamic. Its streetscape is characterized by a lively walkable urban fabric with a friendly human scaled environment under the cool shade of tropical trees and art deco canopies - except at the convention center. It is a dead black hole of asphalt in the heart of one the most beautiful and lively cities in America. Our mission is to bring Miami Beach back to the Convention Center – and to imagine an architecture and an urban space unique to the climate and culture of Miami Beach.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tWe propose to roll out an urban fabric of paths and plazas, parks and gardens that forms an archipelago of urban oases throughout the site. At the heart of it – we introduce a central square to become the pivoting point of the entire neighborhood. Becoming the front door to the convention center, and the convention hotel, a front lawn to the revitalized Jackie Gleason Theatre, a town square for the city hall, an outdoor arena for the Latin American Cultural Museum, and the red carpet for the big botanical ball room.</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>    \n<div>\n        <div class=\"picture\" style=\"height:446px\">\n        <a title=\"play video\" href=\"javascript:void(0);\" class=\"lazyvideo\" data-code=\"<iframe src=&quot;http://player.vimeo.com/video/40229132?title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&amp;amp;color=000000&amp;amp;autoplay=1&quot;

key criteria of a project: What is the biggest problem – what is the greatest potential? Rather than arbitrary aesthetic or stylistic prejudice, all decisions are based on project specific information - Information Driven Design.&nbsp;<br>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tOur effort as architects is sandwiched in the window of opportunity between analysis and implementation. And our influence happens in the translation from information to material. In an attempt to increase our sphere of influence on our built environment, we have established BIG IDEAS.&nbsp;<br>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tBIG IDEAS is an internal technology driven special projects unit, expanding the traditional scope of the architect into the realm of information and material. BIG IDEAS explores new intellectual territory in both the digital and material realm through three specific areas.&nbsp;</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>    \n  \n<div>\n        \n                <div class=\"picture\" style=\"height:583px\">\n        <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://big.dk/#projects-hum\">\n            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"http://cdn.big.dk/images/kibisi/5_hum-facade-02_frontend.jpg\" src=\"/layouts/default/css/images/blank.gif\" width=\"800px\" height=\"583px\">\n        </a>\n        </div>\n            \n        <div>\n        <h3>\n            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://big.dk/#projects-hum\">\n                TECHNICAL SIMULATION             </a>\n        </h3>\n        <div>\n            <p>\n\tAs daylight analysis directly influences the building geometry and as studies of thermal exposure, conditions the building envelope, we are increasingly relying on technical simulations that would traditionally be part of the engineering scope. To speed up the feedback loop between design and analysis, between trial and error, we have internalized the environmental analysis into our own office. Daylight, sunshine, thermal exposure, airflow, turbulence, wind, space syntax and traffic flow are technical simulations we now control to enable ourselves to make designs that are literally shaped by the forces that surround them. We still collaborate with the best technical experts to tap into the cutting edge at the horizon of the profession, but we have found it necessary to educate ourselves to wield the digital tools of design. Not just building information management or digitally aided design but also environmental simulation must become part of our architectural tool kit. &nbsp;<br>\n\t<br>\n\tOur line of investigations from the Shenzhen Energy Headquarters to the Hanwha PV Plant to the Cité du Corps Humain, has provided us with a parametric design engine that allows us to tailor building envelopes and façade geometries to respond to different climate conditions across the globe. Our expanded parametric design tools are helping us start to formulate a vernacular architecture 2.0 through engineering without engines.</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>    \n  \n<div>\n        \n                <div class=\"picture\" style=\"height:914px\">\n        <a href=\"#\">\n            <img class=\"lazy\" data-original=\"http://cdn.big.dk/images/kibisi/4_green-and-meinerz_frontend.jpg\" src=\"/layouts/default/css/images/blank.gif\" width=\"800px\" height=\"914px\">\n        </a>\n        </div>\n            \n        <div>\n        <h3>\n            <a href=\"#\">\n                PRODUCT DESIGN             </a>\n        </h3>\n        <div>\n            <p>\n\tOn the other end of the spectrum where the design intelligence gets manifested into the material world, we have increasingly encountered that our imagination was limited to what was already on the shelves.
