Playing scales can also be a great way to improving your technique.</span><br>\n<br>\nBecause of the relationship of notes in certain scales they will always sound well played together. A fact that  makes scales a primary foundation for everyone who wants to improvise on the instrument. This can be done just by playing the white keys as in the C Major scale or it can be more advanced by, for example, using modus for jazz improvisation.

It is boring just to memorize if you don't understand the use of it … Therefore, the idea here is  always to give the musical context for the scale and not just give the tones.</span><br>\n<br>\nIn the sidebar on this site you will find different categories of piano scales and also resources like printable scales and useful tools like explanations of correct fingering. At last there are exercises and some words about the theory of piano scales.</p>\n<div class=\"section2\">\n<span class=\"center\">\n<a href=\"major.html\">See scales diagram</a>\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section2\">\n<p><img src=\"images/whole_tone_mini.png\" alt=\"Whole Tone Scale\" width=\"100\" height=\"75\" class=\"left\"><strong>New scale with pictures and theory: <a href=\"whole-tone.html\">Whole Tone  Scale</a></strong><br>\nA symmetrical scale conisting only of whole tone intervals.<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section2\">\n<p><strong>New article: <a href=\"how-to-build-chords.html\">How to build chords from scales</a></strong><br>\nAn  article that explained how chords and scales are related. </p>\n</div>\n<h2>How to define scales</h2>\n<p>Scales are a collection of tones that belong together, they belong to a certain<em> <a href=\"keys.html\">key</a></em> being more precise. This relationship is also true about chords – but the difference between chords and scales is that a scale normally consists of more notes and they are not played simultaneously which often is the case about chords.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"lilac\">A scale is a collection of notes that have a musical connection and are building blocks for chords and starting-points for improvisation. By knowing and recognizing scales you will be able to place a song in a musical context and as a result be able to play it with less effort. Knowing scales on the piano will of course also assist you in composing your own music.</span></p>\n<h3>Attitudes toward scales</h3>\n<p>As  mentioned above, this part of your piano education is sometimes given negative connotations: scales are intruding on your freedom of creativity and things like that. The truth is that scales aren't some strict rules, but more like a background in your practice. (As a footnote atonal music could be mentioned here, that is a reaction against the tonal music).<br>\n<br>\nExactly which scales you should focus upon will depend on the musical styles that interest you. But generally it is a good advice to learn the common <em>major scales</em> considering how common they are in piano music. Further on you should study the <em>minor scales</em> which exist in three different versions – the natural, the harmonic and the melodic. Don't worry, they are almost similar but the distinctions will give you new possibilities. The <em>pentatonic scales</em> are also common and in some styles the <em>modal scales</em> are frequently used.</p>\n<h3>The keyboard</h3>\n<p>A piano has 88 keys that are put together on a <em>keyboard</em>. As shown in the picture below  the keyboard on a piano is symmetrical arranged in twelve - seven white and five black - keys that are repeated (some exceptions are  shown in the left and right ends). These keys are also ordered in <em>octaves</em> that makes eight notes. Every interval between two notes of the same tone, like a C to a higher C, is an octave.<br>\n<img width=\"572\" height=\"48\" src=\"images/keyboard.png\" alt=\"keyboard of a piano\"></p>\n<h3>The notes</h3>\n<p>Playing piano is often made by reading notes. Below you can see an illustration of notes on a staff - this time as the scale of D major.<br>\n<img width=\"714\" height=\"72\" src=\"images/d-scale.png\" alt=\"Piano notes\"><br>\nOn this site you will find exercises with scales written in notes.</p>\n<h3>Copyright</h3>\n<p>The pictures that illustrate scales on this site are protected by copyright and are not allowed to be used or published without permission.</p>\n<div id=\"ad\">\n<script src=\"https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pub-config/r20160913/ca-pub-1925641163982296.js\"></script><script type=\"text/javascript\" async=\"\" src=\"https://ssl.google-analytics.com/ga.js\"></script><script async=\"\" src=\"//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></script>\n<!-- Pianoscales4 -->\n<ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:336px;height:280px\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-1925641163982296\" data-ad-slot=\"5782447067\" data-adsbygoogle-status=\"done\"><ins id=\"aswift_0_expand\" style=\"display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:336px;background-color:transparent\"><ins id=\"aswift_0_anchor\" style=\"display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:336px;background-color:transparent\"><iframe width=\"336\" height=\"280\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" vspace=\"0\" hspace=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" onload=\"var i=this.id,s=window.google_iframe_oncopy,H=s&amp;&amp;s.handlers,h=H&amp;&amp;H[i],w=this.contentWindow,d;try{d=w.document}catch(e){}if(h&amp;&amp;d&amp;&amp;(!d.body||!d.body.firstChild)){if(h.call){setTimeout(h,0)}else if(h.match){try{h=s.upd(h,i)}catch(e){}w.location.replace(h)}}\" id=\"aswift_0\" name=\"aswift_0\" style=\"left:0;position:absolute;top:0;\"></iframe></ins></ins></ins>\n<script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"clear:both\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"footer\">\n<p>Copyright ©&nbsp;2012-2017 pianoscales.org<br>\n    <a href=\"contact.html\">contact</a> | <a href=\"links.html\">links</a> | <a href=\"sitemap.html\">sitemap</a></p>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">var _gaq=_gaq||[];_gaq.push([\"_setAccount\",\"UA-29001463-1\"]);_gaq.push([\"_trackPageview\"]);(function(){var b=document.createElement(\"script\");b.type=\"text/javascript\";b.async=true;b.src=(\"https:\"==document.location.protocol?\"https://ssl\":\"http://www\")+\".google-analytics.com/ga.js\";var a=document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0];a.parentNode.insertBefore(b,a)})();</script>\n\n</body>"}
