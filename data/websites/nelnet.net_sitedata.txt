If you do not pay the current amount due, your payment will be allocated across the loan group(s) from most delinquent to least delinquent, in proportion to each loan group\\'s regular monthly payment amount, less any amount already paid for that month until each loan group is at the same level of delinquency or all loan groups are up to date.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Once all loan groups are up to date, payments are allocated across loan groups in an active repayment status, in proportion to each loan group\\'s regular monthly payment amount, less any amount already paid for that month.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>If you do not pay the current amount due, every loan group may become delinquent, reported to consumer reporting agencies, be subject to a late fee (if applicable)*, and you could lose eligibility for borrower benefits and repayment incentives. We encourage you to pay as much as you can, because interest accrues on your outstanding principal balance.</strong></p>\n<p>After your current amount due is paid, your payment will be allocated across loan groups in proportion to each loan group\\'s regular monthly payment amount, or in the case of no payment due (if your loans are not in repayment), in proportion to each loan group\\'s accrued interest.</p>\n<p>Once a portion of a payment is allocated to a specific loan group, payments are applied to individual loans proportionally to fees first (if applicable)*, then interest, and then to principal. If you are on an Income-Based, Pay As You Earn, or Revised Pay As You Earn repayment plan, payments are applied to interest, then fees (if applicable)*, and then to principal.</p>\n<p>If you make a payment within 120 days of the date your school disbursed your loan money (the disbursement date), your payment is applied to the original principal balance, which in turn reduces the amount of your loan. There is also a pro-rated reduction of the default/origination fee based on the payment amount that you made. Please note, this excludes loans that are already in repayment and Consolidation loans.</p>\n<p><strong>You have the option to direct your payments (including partial payments) to individual loans or loan groups, as a one-time or recurring special payment instruction. For more information on directing payments, see the question below.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>*Note:</strong> The U.S. Department of Education does not assess late or returned payment fees.</p>','payNowDisclaimer2Display':'true','payNowDisclaimer3Title':'Can I direct payments to loans or loan groups?','payNowDisclaimer3Body':'<p>Yes, <strong>you have the option to direct your payments (including partial payments) to an individual loan or loan group, as a one-time or recurring special payment instruction by contacting us.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 888.486.4722</p>\n<p><strong>Email:</strong> Help@Nelnet.net</p>\n<p><strong>Mail:</strong> Send instructions (including your account number) using our correspondence address: P.O.

If you make a partial payment, your current amount due will be reduced by the amount already paid for that month. If you are billed for $0 under an income-driven repayment plan, prepayments will not advance your due date into the future.</p>\n<p>You can always pay more without penalty, which will reduce your total cost of borrowing and save you money in the long run. If you are not required to make a payment this month, you won&amp;rsquo;t be considered past due if you don&amp;rsquo;t make a payment or pay less than your regular monthly payment amount. However, <strong>we encourage you to continue paying as much as you can even if your current amount due is $0 because interest may continue to accrue on your outstanding principal balance.</strong> To maintain eligibility for borrower benefits and repayment incentives, you may be required to continue making monthly payments even if your current amount due is $0. For more information about prepayments and how they qualify toward benefits, repayment incentives, or loan forgiveness you may be eligible for, contact us.</p>\n<p>If you plan to pursue Public Service Loan Forgiveness, visit StudentAid.ed.gov/PublicService for more information regarding prepayments and how they are counted as qualifying payments.</p>\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> If your current amount due in the month of August is $50 and you make an online payment for $100, your next payment due date will be in October, because $100 pays the amount due in August and September. This does not restrict you from still making a payment in September, if you wish. We encourage you to continue making monthly payments because interest may continue to accrue on your outstanding principal balance.</p>\n<p><strong>You also have the option to instruct us to not advance your due date more than one month, as a one-time or recurring special payment instruction by contacting us.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 888.486.4722</p>\n<p><strong>Email:</strong> Help@Nelnet.net</p>\n<p><strong>Mail:</strong> Send instructions (including your account number) using our correspondence address: P.O.

Ford Federal Direct Loan Program</p>\n<p>WARNING: Any person who knowingly makes a false statement or misrepresentation on this online request or on any accompanying documents is subject to penalties that may include fines, imprisonment, or both, under the U.S. Criminal Code and 20 U.S.C. 1097.</p>\n<p>DEFERMENT REQUEST</p>\n<p>I meet the eligibility requirements stated in the eligibility requirements section for the Rehabilitation Training Deferment and request that the U.S. Department of Education (ED) defer repayment of my loan(s) while I am in a full-time REHABILITATION TRAINING program.</p>\n<p>BORROWER UNDERSTANDINGS, CERTIFICATIONS AND AUTHORIZATION</p>\n<p>I understand that the following terms and conditions apply to this deferment: (1) I am not required to make payments of loan principal during my deferment. No interest will be charged on my subsidized loan(s) during my deferment. However, interest will be charged on my unsubsidized loan(s). For any unsubsidized loan(s), I will receive an interest statement, and I may pay the interest at any time. If I do not pay the interest that accrues on my unsubsidized loan(s), it will be capitalized at the end of my deferment period. (2) My deferment will begin on the date the condition that qualifies me for the deferment began, as certified by the supporting documents sent to my servicer. (3) My deferment will end on the earlier of (A) the date that I no longer meet the condition that qualifies me for the deferment, or (B) the ending date of that condition as certified by the authorized official who signs the supporting documents sent to my servicer. (4) If my deferment does not cover all of my past due payments, ED may grant me a forbearance for all payments that were due before the begin date of my deferment. If the period for which I am eligible for a deferment has ended, ED may grant me a forbearance for all payments that are due at the time my deferment request is processed. (5) ED may grant me a forbearance on my loans for up to 60 days, if necessary, for the collection and processing of documentation related to my deferment request. ED will not capitalize interest that accrues during this forbearance.</p>\n<p>I certify that: (1) The information I have provided in this online request is true and correct. (2) I will provide additional documentation to my servicer, as required, to support my eligibility for this deferment. (3) I will notify my servicer immediately if I no longer meet the condition that qualifies me for this deferment. (4) I have read, understand, and meet the eligibility requirements of the deferment for which I have applied.</p>\n<p>I authorize my schools, ED, and their respective agents and contractors to contact me regarding my loan request or my loan, including repayment of my loan, at the current or any future number that I provide for my cellular telephone or other wireless device using automated dialing equipment or artificial or prerecorded voice or text messages.</p>\n<p>AUTHORIZED OFFICIAL\\'S CERTIFICATION</p>\n<p>In the supporting documents received by my servicer, the authorized official must certify, to the best of their knowledge and belief, that the borrower or student is/was engaged in a ful-time rehabilitation training program, and that the borrower/student and the program meet all of the eligibility requirements stated in the eligibility requirements section. The authorized official must provide the beginning and end date of the program that qualifies the borrower for the deferment.</p>\n<p>INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THE FORM</p>\n<p>Because you are completing the online version of this form, you will be required to submit supporting documents separately. Your deferment will not be processed until we receive all required information.</p>\n<p>DEFINITIONS</p>\n<p>An authorized official who may certify supporting documents required for the authorized official&amp;rsquo;s certification section is an authorized official of the Rehabilitation Training Program.</p>\n<p>Capitalization is the addition of unpaid interest to the principal balance of my FFEL or Direct Loan program loan. The principal balance of a loan increases when payments are postponed during deferment/forbearance and unpaid interest is capitalized. As a result, more interest may accrue over the life of the loan, the monthly payment amount may be higher, or more payments may be required. The chart provides estimates, for a $15,000 loan balance at a 9% interest rate, of the monthly payments due following a 12-month deferment/forbearance. It compares the effects of paying interest, capitalizing interest at the end of a deferment/forbearance, and capitalizing interest quarterly and at the end of a deferment/forbearance. Your actual loan interest cost will depend on your interest rate, length of any deferment/forbearance, frequency of capitalization, and whether interest is payable by the federal government. Paying interest during the period of deferment lowers the monthly payment by about $18 a month or about $772 over the life of the loan, as depicted in the chart below.</p>\n<table cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=&quot;odd&quot;>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>Treatment of Interest Accrued During Deferment</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>Loan Amount</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>Capitalized Interest for 12 Months</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>Principal to Be Repaid</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>Monthly Payment</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>Number of Payments</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>Total Amount Repaid</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>Total Interest Paid</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>Interest is paid</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>$15,000.00</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>$0.00</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>$15,000.00</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>$190.01</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>120</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>$24,151.64*</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>$9,151.64</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=&quot;odd&quot;>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>Interest is capitalized at the end of deferment</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>$15,000.00</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>$1,350.00</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>$16,350.00</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>$207.11</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>120</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>$24,853.79</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>$9,853.79</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>Interest is capitalized quarterly during deferment and at the end of deferment</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>$15,000.00</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>$1,396.25</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>$16,396.25</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>$207.70</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>120</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>$24,924.09</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>$9,924.09</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>*Total amount repaid includes $1,350 of interest paid during the 12-month period of deferment.</p>\n<p>A deferment allows you to temporarily postpone making payments on your loan(s).

Ford Federal Direct Loan Program</p>\n<p>WARNING: Any person who knowingly makes a false statement or misrepresentation on this online request or on any accompanying documents is subject to penalties that may include fines, imprisonment or both, under the U.S. Criminal Code and 20 U.S.C. 1097.</p>\n<p>By submitting this information, you certify that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I meet the qualifications stated in eligibility requirements sectionfor an Unemployment Deferment and request that the U.S. Department of Education (ED) defer repayment of my loan(s) while I am unemployed. I must reapply every 6 months. My maximum eligibility for an unemployment deferment is 36 months.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>BORROWER UNDERSTANDINGS, CERTIFICATIONS AND AUTHORIZATION</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I understand that the following terms and conditions apply to this deferment:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(1) I am not required to make payments of loan principal during my deferment. No interest will be charged on my subsidized loan(s) during my deferment. However, interest will be charged on my unsubsidized loan(s). For any unsubsidized loan(s), I will receive an interest statement, and I may pay the interest at any time. If I do not pay the interest that accrues on my unsubsidized loan(s), it will be capitalized at the end of my deferment period.</p>\n<p>(2) My deferment will begin on the date I became unemployed or began working less than 30 hours per week, as indicated in my online request, unless I request my deferment to begin on a later date. However, if this is my first unemployment deferment request for my current period of unemployment and I am not providing documentation of my eligibility for unemployment benefits, my deferment will begin no more than 6 months before the date my servicer receives this request, even if I became unemployed or began working less than 30 hours per week more than 6 months ago.</p>\n<p>(3) My deferment will end on the earlier of (A) the date I obtain full-time employment, or (B) the deferment end date provided to me by my servicer. An unemployment deferment may last for no more than 6 months after the date my servicer receives my deferment request. I must reapply every 6 months.</p>\n<p>(4) If my deferment does not cover all of my past due payments, ED may grant me a forbearance for all payments that were due before the begin date of my deferment. If the period for which I am eligible for a deferment has ended, ED may grant me a forbearance for all payments that are due at the time my deferment request is processed.</p>\n<p>(5) ED may grant me a forbearance on my loans for up to 60 days, if necessary, for the collection and processing of documentation related to my deferment request. ED will not capitalize interest that accrues during this forbearance.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I certify that: (1) The information I have provided on this online request is true and correct. (2) I will provide additional documentation to my servicer, as required, to support my eligibility for this deferment. (3) I will notify my servicer immediately if I obtain full-time employment. (4) I have read, understand, and meet the eligibility requirements of the deferment for which I have applied.</li>\n<li>I authorize my schools, ED, and their respective agents and contractors to contact me regarding my loan request or my loan, including repayment of my loan, at the current or any future number that I provide for my cellular telephone or other wireless device using automated dialing equipment or artificial or prerecorded voice or text messages.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>DEFINITIONS</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Capitalization is the addition of unpaid interest to the principal balance of my FFEL or Direct Loan program loan. The principal balance of a loan increases when payments are postponed during deferment/forbearance and unpaid interest is capitalized. As a result, more interest may accrue over the life of the loan, the monthly payment amount may be higher, or more payments may be required. The chart provides estimates, for a $15,000 loan balance at a 9% interest rate, of the monthly payments due following a 12-month deferment/forbearance. It compares the effects of paying interest, capitalizing interest at the end of a deferment/forbearance, and capitalizing interest quarterly and at the end of a deferment/forbearance. Your actual loan interest cost will depend on your interest rate, length of any deferment/forbearance, frequency of capitalization, and whether interest is payable by the federal government. Paying interest during the period of deferment lowers the monthly payment by about $18 a month or about $772 over the life of the loan, as depicted in the chart below.</li>\n</ul>\n<table cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=&quot;odd&quot;>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>Treatment of Interest Accrued During Deferment</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>Loan Amount</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>Capitalized Interest for 12 Months</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>Principal to Be Repaid</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>Monthly Payment</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>Number of Payments</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>Total Amount Repaid</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>Total Interest Paid</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>Interest is paid</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>$15,000.00</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>$0.00</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>$15,000.00</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>$190.01</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>120</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>$24,151.64*</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>$9,151.64</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=&quot;odd&quot;>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>Interest is capitalized at the end of deferment</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>$15,000.00</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>$1,350.00</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>$16,350.00</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>$207.11</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>120</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>$24,853.79</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>$9,853.79</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>Interest is capitalized quarterly during deferment and at the end of deferment</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>$15,000.00</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>$1,396.25</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>$16,396.25</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>$207.70</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>120</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>$24,924.09</td>\n<td style=&quot;border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;&quot;>$9,924.09</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>*Total amount repaid includes $1,350 of interest paid during the 12-month period of deferment.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A deferment allows you to temporarily postpone making payments on your loan(s).
