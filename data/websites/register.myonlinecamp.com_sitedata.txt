Our cookies do not automatically collect personally identifying information. We may use information collected from cookies to recognize your browser when you visit the Site, to facilitate easy login, to attempt to personalize the Site for each user, to ensure that your browser does or does not see the same ad over and over again, to sequence ads and offers in a series and to track page usage and paths, to help serve advertisements, or to facilitate your ability to navigate the Site.

Separately, third party companies that serve advertisements on the Site may use cookies and other tracking information to collect information about your visits to the Site and other websites.</p>\n\n<h2>IDENTITY VERIFICATION</h2>\n<p>A.\tUser verification on the Internet is difficult and CMS cannot and does not confirm each User's purported identity.</p>\n<p>B.\tYou agree to (i) keep your password and user name secure and strictly confidential, providing it only to authorized users of your account, (ii) instruct each person to whom you give your user name and password that he or she is not to disclose it to any unauthorized person, (iii) notify CMS immediately and select a new user name and password if you believe your password may have become known to an unauthorized person, and (iv) notify CMS immediately if you are contacted by anyone requesting your user name and password.  When you give someone your user name and online password, you are authorizing that person to access and use your account, and you are responsible for any and all transactions that person performs while using your account, even those transactions that are fraudulent or that you did not intend or want performed.</p>\n<p>C.\tEACH USER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT: (i) NEITHER THE SITE NOR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES WILL HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO ANY USER FOR ANY UNAUTHORIZED TRANSACTION MADE USING ANY USER'S PASSWORD THAT OCCURS BEFORE SUCH USER HAS NOTIFIED US OF POSSIBLE UNAUTHORIZED USE OF SUCH PASSWORD AND CMS HAVE HAD A REASONABLE OPPORTUNITY TO ACT ON THAT NOTICE; AND (ii) THE UNAUTHORIZED USE OF YOUR USER NAME AND PASSWORD COULD CAUSE YOU TO INCUR LIABILITY TO BOTH THE SITE AND OTHER USERS AND/OR VISITORS.  Further, CMS may suspend or cancel your account at any time even without receiving notice from you if CMS suspects that your password is being used in an unauthorized or fraudulent manner.</p>\n<p>D.\tCMS does not tolerate spam. Therefore, without limiting the foregoing, you are not licensed to have more than one User account without CMS's express consent.</p>\n\n<h2>GENERAL RELEASE</h2>\n<p>CMS HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OUR INDIRECT DAMAGES, IN CONNECTION WITH THE GOODS OR SERVICES PROVIDED BY AN EVENT OPERATOR, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LIABILITY FOR ANY ACT, ERROR, OMISSION, INJURY, LOSS, ACCIDENT, DELAY OR IRREGULARITY WHICH MAY BE INCURRED THROUGH THE FAULT, NEGLIGENT OR OTHERWISE, OF SUCH EVENT OPERATOR AND YOU HEREBY EXONERATE AND FOREVER RELEASE CMS FROM ANY LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO THE SAME.
