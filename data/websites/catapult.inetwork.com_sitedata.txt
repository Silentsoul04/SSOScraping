(including any documents referenced therein, all of which are fully incorporated by reference within these Terms and Conditions).  Capitalized terms not elsewhere defined in these Terms and Conditions will have the meaning ascribed to them in the Terms of Service.</h2><h3>1. Service Descriptions of Inbound Calling, Outbound Calling and SMS.  The following describe Inbound Calling, Outbound Calling and SMS provided to You pursuant to the Service Order Form and Terms of Service.</h3><p>(A) Inbound Calling provides the origination of voice traffic from the PSTN or an On-Net IP-enabled endpoint to Your (or Your User, customer’s or End User’s) premises via the Session Initiation Protocol (“SIP”).  Inbound Calling is based on RFC 3261 (“SIP-Session Initiation Protocol”) and requires You to conform to RFC 3261 at Your sole expense.   INBOUND CALLING is an Inbound call service ONLY.  INBOUND CALLING EXCLUDES THE FOLLOWING:</p><p class=\"toc-indent\">a) Outbound Calling;</p><p class=\"toc-indent\">b) 911 / E911;</p><p class=\"toc-indent\">c) Directory services including, but not limited to, 411 and NPA-555-xxxx;</p><p class=\"toc-indent\">d) 711;</p><p class=\"toc-indent\">e) 611;</p><p class=\"toc-indent\">f) Any and all other x11 services;</p><p class=\"toc-indent\">g) Operator Services;</p><p class=\"toc-indent\">h) Collect Calling;</p><p class=\"toc-indent\">i) Any and all other operator, assisted, or intercept calling services;</p><p class=\"toc-indent\">j) Caller ID Name or Location;</p><p class=\"toc-indent\">k) Class 5 Features;</p><p class=\"toc-indent\">l) Toll Free numbers / inbound Toll Free calling (unless otherwise expressly agreed in writing between Bandwidth and You); and/or</p><p class=\"toc-indent\">m) 976, 900, and 1010xxx calling.</p><p>You may not (i) use or otherwise enable any TNs provided by Bandwidth (or its affiliates) at any time in connection with any Usage, SMS and/or any other form of traffic other than Usage, SMS and/or any other form of traffic from Bandwidth and its affiliates, or (ii) establish and/or operate peer-to-peer relationships with any third party(ies) with respect to any TNs provided by Bandwidth (or its affiliates) at any time.  For clarity, “peer-to-peer relationships” mean direct network interconnection arrangements that permit Customer and any applicable third party to exchange traffic associated with TNs provided by Bandwidth directly to each other without utilizing Bandwidth’s network with respect to such traffic.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, You will be responsible for all liability arising from its acts and omissions in establishing and/or operating such peer-to-peer relationships, and will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Bandwidth (and its affiliates) from and against any and all third party claims in relation to such acts and omissions in accordance with and subject to the terms of the Terms of Service.</p><p>(B) Outbound Calling provides the termination of IP voice traffic from Your (or Your User, customer’s or End User’s) premises to the PSTN or an On-Net IP-enabled endpoint.  Outbound Calling is an outbound call service ONLY AND DOES NOT INCLUDE 911 / E911.  OUTBOUND CALLING EXCLUDES THE FOLLOWING:</p><p class=\"toc-indent\">n) Inbound calling;</p><p class=\"toc-indent\">o) 911 / E911;</p><p class=\"toc-indent\">p) Operator Services;</p><p class=\"toc-indent\">q) Collect Calling;</p><p class=\"toc-indent\">r) Any and all other operator, assisted, or intercept calling services;</p><p class=\"toc-indent\">s) Class 5 Features; and/or</p><p class=\"toc-indent\">t) 976, 900, and 1010xxx calling.</p><p>Outbound Calling does not include N11 Services, including, but not limited to, 411, 511, 711, 811 and NPA-555-xxxx (“N11 Services”).</p><p>(C) SMS is a Short Message Service delivering messages between Your IP address(es) or domain(s) and Bandwidth’s SMS facilities.  SMS is designed for a natural person and for person-to-person messaging only, meaning each SMS message must be initiated due to human interaction (as opposed to automated or timed messages). An SMS message may originate from a mobile phone, a computer or an Internet-based service, but the SMS message must be initiated due to human interaction, versus an automated or timed message. Each SMS message is viewed as a single instantiation of these definitions (i.e., if a message is transmitted from a natural person to an application and a subsequent message is transmitted from the application to a natural person, such as an SMS search function).  Although the round-trip appears as though the SMS message originated from a natural person back to the same natural person, each SMS message is viewed individually. To that end, the initial SMS message in the foregoing example constitutes a single SMS message sent from a natural person to an application and the subsequent SMS message constitutes a single SMS message sent from an application to a natural person.  Any SMS message originating other than from a natural person for person-to-person messaging constitutes a violation of the Acceptable Use Policy and a Default pursuant to the Terms of Service and these Terms and Conditions.</p><p>You may not (i) use or otherwise enable any TNs provided by Bandwidth (or its affiliates) at any time in connection with Usage, SMS and/or any other form of traffic other than Usage, SMS and/or any other form of traffic from Bandwidth and its affiliates, or (ii) establish and/or operate peer-to-peer relationships with any third party(ies) with respect to any TNs provided by Bandwidth (or its affiliates) at any time.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, You will be responsible for all liability arising from its acts and omissions in establishing and/or operating such peer-to-peer relationships, and will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Bandwidth (and its affiliates) from and against any and all third party claims in relation to such acts and omissions in accordance with and subject to the Terms of Service.</p><p><strong>Message Routing:</strong></p><p><strong>All Bandwidth TNs used for message routing with SMS will be used for both Outbound and Inbound messaging:</strong></p><p>Outbound - Outbound SMS delivers IP-originated messages over SIP or the Bandwidth API to Bandwidth and routes those messages to SMS-enabled TNs on the PSTN; and</p><p>Inbound - Inbound SMS routes SMS messages sent to an SMS-enabled TN on Bandwidth’s network to Bandwidth’s customers, including, without limitation, Your End Users, through the Internet using SIP or the Bandwidth API.</p><p>You may not use Bandwidth’s TNs or DID/DODs to route messages over any another provider’s network.</p><p><strong>Maximum Messages Per Second:</strong><!-- react-text: 130 --> SMS limits the maximum number of SMS messages You may transmit measured on a per second basis. The maximum number of SMS messages per second You may transmit with respect to any TN is limited to one (1).  For clarity, the foregoing maximum number of SMS messages per second You may transmit includes all SMS messages sent and/or received by all Your End Users on an aggregated basis with respect to any one (1) TN.<!-- /react-text --></p><p><strong>Message Rating:</strong><!-- react-text: 133 -->  SMS rates SMS messages for billing purposes on a per SMS message sent and/or received basis. Billable components of each SMS message are based on: (i) the authorized IP sending an SMS message (“Outbound Message”), and (ii) You and/or subscriber of a TN or DID/DOD (also known as destination number) receiving an SMS message (“Inbound Message”).  If any fee(s) is imposed by any destination network, including, without limitation, any international termination fee(s), Bandwidth will charge You such fee(s) and reserves the right to include an administrative or other fee(s) in addition to any such fee(s).<!-- /react-text --></p><p><strong>Service Limitations:</strong><!-- react-text: 136 -->  SMS is an SMS messaging service only and does not provide any audio and/or voice capabilities and/or features. SMS is not intended for and may not be used for advertising, branding or other promotional activities. In addition to any other rights or remedies that Bandwidth may have under any applicable circumstances, Bandwidth, in its sole and unfettered discretion, may block any SMS messaging traffic Bandwidth deems to be in violation of the Terms of Service, these Terms and Conditions, the Acceptable Use Policy, and/or any agreements, arrangements and/or practices of or between Bandwidth and any carriers and/or other service providers.  Bandwidth does not allow more than one (1) outbound message per second from any SMS-enabled TN.  Any violation of any of the foregoing provisions of this paragraph could cause Your TN and/or any applicable TN to be blocked for outbound SMS message transmission by Bandwidth and/or traffic blocking and/or black-listing by any applicable receiving carriers and/or other service providers; Bandwidth does not guarantee removal from any applicable black-listed status.  Bandwidth may block at any time any SMS messages deemed by Bandwidth in its sole and unfettered discretion to jeopardize the integrity of Bandwidth’s network (including, without limitation, due to any action taken and/or threatened by any third party carrier and/or other service provider); any such blockage will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy that Bandwidth may have due to any such SMS messages pursuant to the Terms of Service, these Terms and Conditions, the Acceptable Use Policy or otherwise.  If any such blocking of any SMS messages occurs, Bandwidth may in its discretion attempt to block only the TNs breaching these Terms and Conditions and/or jeopardizing Bandwidth’s network; if the blocking of individual TNs is not feasible for any reason, as determined by Bandwidth in its sole and unfettered discretion, Bandwidth reserves the right to block all SMS message(s) initiated by You and/or any applicable End Users, customers and/or subscriber(s) of Yours.  In the event Bandwidth blocks materially more TNs than the number of breaching TNs, You will have the right to terminate upon written notice to Bandwidth not later than thirty (30) days after such blocking.  If Bandwidth blocks any SMS messages pursuant to this paragraph, Bandwidth will notify You and make commercially reasonable attempts to notify You in advance of such blockage; provided, however, Bandwidth will be under no obligation to provide any prior notification, including, without limitation, if circumstances do not permit delay of any blockage or other action by Bandwidth for any reason. You acknowledge and agree that SMS messages to or from You or Your End Users, customers and/or subscribers may be blocked by carriers or other service providers for reasons known or unknown to Bandwidth; Bandwidth is under no obligation to investigate or remedy any such blockage for You or any of Your End Users, customers or subscribers.  Bandwidth does not guarantee delivery, regardless of the reason, of any SMS messages; You will indemnify and hold Bandwidth harmless with respect to any and all damages or losses that You, Your End Users, customers or subscribers and/or any third party sustains due to any SMS messages being delivered incorrectly or not at all.<!-- /react-text --></p><p><strong>Call Recording:</strong><!-- react-text: 139 -->  The Inbound Calling and Outbound Calling may provide a function that allows the recording of individual telephone conversations.  Bandwidth will retain any recording for one (1) year from the date of any applicable recording, unless the Terms of Service earlier terminate, in which event Bandwidth will have no further obligation to retain any recording thereafter.  The laws regarding the notice, notification, and consent requirements for&nbsp;recording conversations vary from state to state. In some states, one must obtain consent from all parties to&nbsp;record a conversation.  You (and any applicable End User) are solely responsible for complying with all federal, state, and local laws in any relevant jurisdiction when using this feature. Bandwidth expressly disclaims all liability with respect to the recording of telephone conversations.  You agree to fully, finally, and forever release, discharge, hold harmless, and fully indemnify Bandwidth from and against any damages or liabilities of any kind related to the recording of any telephone conversations using either Inbound Calling or Outbound Calling.<!-- /react-text --></p><h3>2.

By displaying any number in any outbound caller ID, You represent and warrant to Bandwidth that You have obtained from either Bandwidth or any other third party 911 services with respect to such number.</strong></p><h3>3. IP Originated Usage.</h3><p>You represent and warrant to Bandwidth that all Your Outbound Calling and/or Usage will be IP Originated.</p><p class=\"toc-indent\">(i)  You represent and warrant to Bandwidth that all of the services and capacity to be purchased from Bandwidth will be used by You to provide an “enhanced service” as defined in 47 C.F.R. Section 64.702(a) and/or an “information service” as defined in 47 U.S.C. Section 153(20).</p><p class=\"toc-indent\">(ii)  If any ruling, decision or determination by the FCC, a PUC, any state regulatory agency, or any court concerning internet-enabled calls is inconsistent with the description of an IP Originated call as described in these Terms and Conditions, Bandwidth reserves the right to modify or amend the description to be consistent with such ruling, decision or determination.  If any such modification or amendment materially adversely affects You, then You will have thirty (30) calendar days after such amendment or modification to notify Bandwidth in writing of such material adverse effect.  Section 15 of the Terms of Service will apply upon Your delivery of such notice to Bandwidth.  If You fail to notify Bandwidth in writing within such thirty (30) calendar day period, You will have accepted such amendment or modification.</p><p class=\"toc-indent\">(iii)  If any third party asserts at any time that any of Your calls and/or Usage is not IP Originated, You will, at Your sole expense, cooperate with Bandwidth and provide reasonable evidence to demonstrate that any applicable calls are IP Originated.</p><p class=\"toc-indent\">(iv)  If it is determined at any time that any calls and/or Usage sent to Bandwidth by You for termination are not IP Originated, in addition to any applicable Fees, You will pay Bandwidth a Non-IP Originated Surcharge of $0.10 per minute.</p><h3>4. Connection.</h3><p>You must connect to Bandwidth’s network in a manner and at locations determined by Bandwidth. You will, at Your sole cost, be responsible: (i) for providing all equipment (including proxy servers), software, facilities and IP connectivity (including, without limitation, connectivity to Your End Users, customers or subscribers) necessary for Your Inbound Calling, Outbound Calling and/or SMS applications and Your network to operate with Inbound Calling, Outbound Calling and/or SMS, and for providing and ensuring the successful installation of all equipment and software necessary for Your End Users, customers or subscribers to use services sold to such End Users, customers or subscribers; (ii) to obtain and provide to Bandwidth, prior to installation of any Inbound Calling, Outbound Calling and/or SMS service offered by You to Your End Users, customers and/or subscribers, the IP address(es) for the proxy server, Your Inbound Calling, Outbound Calling, and/or SMS application and/or any other applicable hardware/software solution.  You may cause Your End Users, customers and/or subscribers to deliver such information to You; provided, however, as between Bandwidth and You, all information required to support Your use of Inbound Calling, Outbound Calling and/or SMS will be supplied to Bandwidth by You.  You will have the sole responsibility to input, validate and maintain accurate information with respect to Your End Users, customers and/or subscribers; You will furthermore be solely responsible for any and all support of and for Your End Users, customers, and/or subscribers as it relates to Inbound Calling, Outbound Calling and/or SMS.  You are responsible for maintaining continuous availability to receive SMS messages from Bandwidth via IP connectivity.  YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD BANDWIDTH HARMLESS AGAINST ANY AND ALL CLAIMS AND EXPENSES RESULTING FROM THE FAILURE OF YOU, YOUR USERS AND/OR END USERS TO COMPLY WITH THIS SECTION.</p><h3>5. Interoperability.</h3><p>If applicable, You and Bandwidth will reasonably cooperate with each other to test to ensure interoperability between Bandwidth and Your  networks and systems. All necessary interoperability testing will be completed within a reasonable time. If after completion of initial interoperability, You plan to make upgrades, updates and/or enhancements (collectively “Configuration Changes”), You will notify Bandwidth prior to implementing a Configuration Change so that You and Bandwidth may work together in good faith to determine how best to proceed regarding such Configuration Change. If at any time an interoperability condition occurs that adversely affects Bandwidth’s network that cannot be adequately remedied within a reasonable period of time, taking into consideration the severity of the interoperability condition and the effect on Bandwidth’s network, Bandwidth may, at its sole discretion, suspend the provision of Inbound Calling, Outbound Calling and/or SMS.</p><h3>6. Charges and Fees.</h3><p>You represent and warrant to Bandwidth that You have received and reviewed the Fees described in the Terms of Service.  All such Fees and/or any other applicable charges, fees, including, without limitation, with respect to the porting of TNs, will be subject to the Terms of Service and, if applicable, the terms and conditions of Your underlying provider of voice service(s) that You purchase and to which SMS has been added, if applicable.  Miscellaneous charges and/or fees imposed by any third party carrier or any underlying provider from time to time, whether charged to or against Bandwidth, will be payable by You, including, without limitation, any cost recovery fee which shall represent an accurate and non-inflated recovery of the miscellaneous charges and/or fees to or against Bandwidth associated with the provision of Service(s) by Bandwidth to You.  Billing increments will be in whole minute increments, except with respect to SMS.</p><p><strong>Call Rating:</strong><!-- react-text: 163 --> Outbound Calling only provides Interstate, Intrastate, and, if expressly contracted in writing, International Call Termination. No outbound local calling or inbound calling service is provided.<!-- /react-text --></p><p><strong>Interstate Outbound Calling Fees:</strong><!-- react-text: 166 --> Bandwidth does not guarantee call delivery and may block specific routes at any time.<!-- /react-text --></p><p><strong>Intrastate Outbound Calling Fees:</strong><!-- react-text: 169 --> Bandwidth does not guarantee call delivery and may block specific routes at any time.<!-- /react-text --></p><p><strong>International Fees:</strong><!-- react-text: 172 --> Outbound Calling pursuant to these Terms and Conditions does not include International Call Termination unless expressly agreed in writing.  If nonetheless utilized, Bandwidth’s then-prevailing applicable Fees will apply.  All Fees applicable to International Call Termination are subject to change upon five (5) calendar days prior notice from Bandwidth.  Bandwidth does not guarantee call delivery and may block specific routes at any time.<!-- /react-text --></p><h3>7. TN Availability.</h3><p>Bandwidth will exercise commercially reasonable efforts to gain access to requested TNs, but Bandwidth does not guarantee TN availability. Bandwidth may, upon fourteen (14) business days prior written notice, reclaim any TNs that have not been used to pass traffic within the immediately preceding 120 day period.  Bandwidth will not reclaim a TN without prior written notice to You followed by such fourteen (14) business day cure period if You remedy such non-use during such fourteen (14) day cure period.</p><h3>8. Porting Numbers.</h3><p>Bandwidth may require a completed and signed Letter of Authorization (“LOA”) for any existing telephone numbers You wish to port from another carrier to Bandwidth. Bandwidth may require a recent copy of the current phone bill which contains Your Billing Telephone Number (“BTN”) as well as a record of any numbers that need to be ported. Bandwidth must receive necessary LOA(s) and/or bill copy(ies) before Bandwidth will initiate a port request and obtain a Confirmed Port Date.  The “Confirmed Port Date” is the date upon which the current voice provider has agreed to port a number(s) to Bandwidth.  The Confirmed Port Date interval may in some cases take as long as one (1) to two (2) business weeks after You initiate the port request; since the port interval is a product of the accuracy of the information provided to Bandwidth by You, as well as the processing speed of Your current voice provider, Bandwidth makes no guarantees regarding the promptness of a port, however all ports will be provided consistent with applicable law.</p><h3>9. Call Completion.</h3><p>Bandwidth reserves the right to block or otherwise restrict termination of calls to any and all termination calling destinations, whether or not included in Fees provided to You, and without notice to You. Bandwidth does not guarantee call completion, and the failure to complete any or all calls, regardless of reason, will not constitute a breach of these Terms of Service.  Bandwidth does not guarantee call completion, and the failure to complete any or all calls, regardless of reason, shall not constitute a breach of the Terms of Service and/or these Terms and Conditions.  NO SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT OR SLA APPLIES TO OUTBOUND CALLING.</p><h3>10. Forecasting.</h3><p>From time to time, Bandwidth may request from You a forecast of expected Usage volumes and/or TN procurement. You will cooperate with such requests. In the event You anticipate changes in Usage volumes, You will proactively contact Bandwidth to review such changes.  Bandwidth will use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain adequate capacity to meet Your forecasts.  Bandwidth’s failure to adequately provide capacity, regardless of reason, will not constitute a breach of the Terms of Service or these Terms and Conditions.</p><h3>11. Responsibility to Control and Manage Traffic.</h3><p>In addition to any other terms and conditions of the Terms of Service and/or these Terms and Conditions, You will bear the following responsibilities in connection with Bandwidth’s provision of Outbound Calling: (i) You will manage the integrity of the traffic egressing Your network, and (ii) in addition to Your obligations pursuant to Section 12 below of these Terms and Conditions, You will manage and correct, as necessary, any fraudulent calling patterns or calling patterns perceived as fraudulent that may harm Bandwidth’s network.  If You fail to comply with the foregoing obligations of this Section 11, (i) Bandwidth will have the right (but not the obligation) to take protective action against You to protect Bandwidth’s egress network.
