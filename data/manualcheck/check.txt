Manual check of 100 websites starting at 200:
9gag.com - Facebook, google [Crawler detected only google not facebook. See pic. Not sure why.]
reimagineplus.com - No SSO [Crawler got it right]
youm7.com - No SSO [Crawler got it right]
softonic.com - Facebook, Google [Crawler did not detect either because there was no "Login with"]
indiatimes.com - Facebook, Google [Crawler did not detect because there was no signup/login link (instead there was an action to open a popup) and the crawler's gamble to get to url/login or /signup turned up a 404. See pic]
amazon.fr - No SSO [Crawler detected 500px - openid which is wrong. The other values are amazon itself so it doesnt make a difference]
github.io - No SSO [Crawler got it right]
etsy.com - Facebook, Google [Crawler got both but has an extra value of twitter which is a False Positive (FP)]
mercadolivre.com.br - No SSO [Crawler got it right]
weebly.com - Facebook, Google [Crawler did not detect either because there was no "Login with". See pic.]
abs-cbn.com - No SSO [Crawler got it right]
outbrain.com - No SSO [Crawler got it right]
