PRIVACY POLICY </strong></p><p>Last updated: June 2016 </p><p>This privacy policy (“Policy”) explains how personal information is collected, used, and disclosed by StartDate Labs, Inc. dba StartWire (“StartWire,” “we,” or “us”) in connection with your use of the website published on <a href=\"//www.startwire.com\">www.startwire.com </a>(the “Site”) so you can make an informed decision about using the Site. We reserve the right to change the provisions of this Policy at any time. We will alert you that changes have been made by indicating on the Policy the date it was last updated. We encourage you to review this Policy from time to time to make sure that you understand how certain types of information you provide will be used. </p><p><strong>What Type of Information Do We Collect? </strong></p><p><strong>Personal Information. </strong>Personal information means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, full mailing address, telephone number, mobile number, e-mail address, or credit card number). Personal information does not include “aggregate” or anonymized information, e.g., data we collect about the use of the Site or about a group or category of services or users, from which personal information that specifically identifies you has been removed. This Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection, use or disclosure of aggregate or anonymized information. </p><p><strong>Demographic Information. </strong>Demographic information is information that is not unique to you in the sense that it refers to selected population characteristics, such as your ZIP code or postal code, age, preferences, gender, race or ethnicity, occupation, career history, interests and favorites. We may use and disclose demographic information for any purpose. </p><p><strong>Behavioral Information. </strong>We also collect behavioral information regarding how you use the Site, the areas of the Site you visit, what services you access, and information about your computer hardware and software, including your IP address, geolocation, browser and operating system type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. This information is necessary for analyzing the use of resources, troubleshooting problems, preventing fraud, improving our services and other lawful purpose. We may use and disclose behavioral information for any purpose. </p><p><strong>Third Party Log-in Credentials. </strong>In order to use certain services on our Site, we may request your login credentials to third party websites. For example, if you request us to track your job application on a potential employer’s human resource website, we may need your log-in credentials (e.g., login and password) to do so. By submitting your log-in credentials to us, you give us a right to use such login credentials on your behalf to access the third party website and the information derived from such access. We may collect information through our use of the log-in credential (e.g., status of job application) and we will handle such information in accordance with this Policy. </p><p><strong>How Do We Collect Information? </strong></p><p><strong>Active Collection: </strong>We collect certain information you voluntarily provide to us, such as when you sign up to use a service offered on the Site. Such information may include personal information, such as your name and email address. Personal and demographic information may also be collected if you provide such information in connection with any comments you post on or through the Site or participate in any other interactive forums or features on the Site. In addition, from time to time we may collect demographic, contact or other personal information you provide in connection with your participation in surveys, promotional offers, and other activities on the Site. </p><p><strong>Passive Collection: </strong>When you use the Site, some information is also automatically collected, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your operating system, the browser type, the address of a referring website, and your activity on the Site. We treat this information as personal information if we combine it with or link it to any of the identifying information mentioned above. Otherwise, it is used in the aggregate only. </p><p><strong>Cookies: </strong>We may also automatically collect certain information through the use of “cookies,” web beacons or similar mechanisms. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive at the request of a website. Among other things, cookies help us improve our Site and your experience. If you wish to block, erase, or be warned of cookies, please refer to your browser manufacturer to learn about these functions. However, if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services on our Site. Web beacons are small, invisible graphic images that may be used on the Site or in emails relating to the Site to collect certain information and monitor user activity on the Site. </p><p><strong>Disclosure Regarding Third Party Cookies. </strong>From time to time we may allow third parties to collect information when you visit the Site. These third parties may utilize cookies, web beacons or other similar mechanisms to collect non-personal information, and such information may be used, among other things, to analyze data, to determine the popularity of certain content, and to better understand the usage and visitation of our Site and the other sites tracked by these third parties. In some instances, the information collected through the use of these technologies may be used to deliver advertising targeted to your interests. Our Service Providers and third-party sites use this information to recognize you across different channels and platforms over time for advertising, analytics, attribution, and reporting purposes. To learn more about the behavioral advertising practices or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit the websites of the Digital Advertising Alliance at <a href=\"http://www.aboutads.info\">www.aboutads.info </a>or Networking Advertising Initiative at <a href=\"http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices\">www.networkadvertising.org/choices </a>. This Policy does not apply to the collection and use practices of the third parties utilizing these technologies. </p><p><strong>How Do We Use the Personal Information We Collect? </strong></p><p>We use personal information collected through our Site for the purposes described in this Policy or elsewhere on the Site. For example, we may use personal information we collect: </p><p>(a) to provide the services, products, or information you request, and to process and complete any transactions in connection therewith; </p><p>(b) to request feedback and to otherwise contact you about your use of the Site; </p><p>(c) to respond to your emails, submissions, questions, comments, requests, and complaints and provide customer service; </p><p>(d) to monitor and analyze site usage and trends, and to personalize and improve the Site and our users’ experiences on the Site, such as providing ads, content, or features that match their profiles or interests, and to increase the Site’s functionality and user friendliness; </p><p>(e) to provide you with news and information about our or third party events, activities, offers, promotions, products, and services we think will be of interest to you; </p><p>(f) to send you confirmations, updates, security alerts, and support and administrative messages and otherwise facilitate your use of, and our administration and operation of, the Site; </p><p>(g) to notify you about important changes to our Site; and </p><p>(h) for any other purpose authorized or requested by you. </p><p><strong>What Personal Information Do We Share With Third Parties? </strong></p><p>We will not share the personal information we collect from you through this Site with third parties, except as described in this Policy or on the Site. We may share personal information as follows: </p><p>(a) with vendors, consultants, and other service providers, such as payment processors (“Service Providers”) who are engaged by or working with us in connection with the operation of the Site or the services we provide and who need access to such information to carry out their work for us; </p><p>(b) when you give us your consent to do so, such as if you opt in to receive marketing communications from third parties or if we otherwise notify you on the Site that the information you provide will be shared in a particular manner and you provide such information; </p><p>(c) when we believe in good faith that we are lawfully authorized or required to do so or that doing so is reasonably necessary or appropriate to: (a) comply with the law or legal processes or respond to lawful requests or legal authorities, including responding to lawful subpoenas, warrants, or court orders; or (b) protect the rights, property, or safety of StartWire, our users, our employees, copyright owners, third parties or the public, including without limitation to protect StartWire or our users from fraudulent, abusive, inappropriate, or unlawful use of our Site; </p><p>(d) to enforce or apply this Policy, our Terms and Conditions, or our other policies or agreements; and </p><p>(e) in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition, as well as in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or in any other situation where personal information may be disclosed or transferred as one of the business assets of StartWire. </p><p>The Site includes features which enable you to post content or otherwise share information about yourself and your posting or resume. You understand that if you use such features or otherwise post any content through the Site, the information you post will be available to other users and other websites, and in some cases may be publicly available. We recommend you be cautious about giving out personal information to others or sharing personal information through the Site. </p><p>We are not responsible for the actions of Service Providers or other third parties, nor are we responsible for any additional information you provide directly to any third parties, and we encourage you to become familiar with their privacy practices before disclosing information directly to any such parties. </p><p><strong>How Will You Handle My Resume? </strong></p><p>If you submit your resume to the Site, then all parties with access to our searchable resume database (or copies thereof) will have access to your resume. Employers or other parties with access to our searchable resume database may be located in countries whose data protection legislation may not be equivalent to the laws in your country. For example, your resume may be viewed and accessed by employers outside the European Economic Area who have access to our searchable database. By making your resume searchable, you are expressly consenting to such transfers of data. </p><p>We attempt to limit access to our searchable resume database to legitimate users such as bona fide employers, recruiters, hiring managers, headhunters and human resource professionals, as well as law enforcement and national security agencies, but we cannot guarantee that other parties will not gain access to this database. We cannot control the use made of resumes by third parties who access such resumes while they are in our searchable database. Even if we offer functionality that allows you to remove your resume, employers, recruiters and others who have paid for access to that database, as well as parties who have otherwise gained access to the database may have retained a copy of your resume in their own files or databases. We cannot control the retention, use or privacy of resumes or profiles that have been downloaded by third parties. Accordingly, you should not put sensitive information, personality profiles, or other information you would not want made public, in your resume. </p><p>We will use personal information within your resume in accordance with this Policy, however, we may use demographic, aggregate and behavioral information for any purpose. </p><p><strong>Links to Other Websites </strong></p><p>Our Site may contain links to websites operated by third parties. Any personal information you provide on or through the linked pages is provided directly to that third party and is subject to that third party’s privacy policy. This Policy does not apply to such linked websites, and we are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of these websites or any other websites operated by third parties that are linked to from the Site. We encourage you to learn about their privacy and security practices and policies before providing them with personal information. </p><p><strong>What Steps Do We Take To Protect Your Information Online? </strong></p><p>We take reasonable measures to protect your personal information in an effort to prevent loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Please be aware, however, that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable and no method of data transmission that can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse. To protect the confidentiality of your personal information, you should keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. You are solely responsible for all use of the Site and our services by any person using your password. </p><p><strong>What Choices Do You Have Regarding the Use of Your Information? </strong></p><p>You may “opt out” of receiving marketing or promotional emails from us by following the instructions in those emails. If you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional emails, such as emails about your accounts or our ongoing business relations. </p><p><strong>Your California Rights </strong></p><p>A California resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes (“California customer”) is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a request by a California customer, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that were disclosed. </p><p>However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy) a policy of not disclosing customer’s personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right. </p><p>We do not share personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure. To prevent disclosure of your personal information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt in to such use when you provide personally identifiable information on our Site. Please note that whenever you opt in to receive future communications from a third party, your information will be subject to the third party’s privacy policy. If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact the third party directly, as we have no control over how third parties use information. You should always review the privacy policy of any party that collects your information to determine how that entity will handle your information. </p><p>California customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by e-mailing <a href=\"mailto:privacy@startdatelabs.com\">privacy@startdatelabs.com </a>. Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this e-mail address. </p><p><strong>Children Under Age 13 </strong></p><p>The Site is not intended for children under age 13. No one under age 13 may provide any information to or on the Site. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under age 13; nor do we allow such persons to use the Site or our services. If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under age 13, please contact us at <a href=\"mailto:privacy@startdatelabs.com\">privacy@startdatelabs.com </a>. </p><p><strong>Questions? </strong></p><p>If you have any questions about this Policy, please contact us at <a href=\"mailto:privacy@startdatelabs.com\">privacy@startdatelabs.com </a>. </p></div></div><div class=\"modal-overlay invisible\"><div class=\"transparency\"></div><div class=\"modal-popup\"><div class=\"popup js-modal-popup-container\"></div></div></div><div class=\"modal-overlay invisible\"><div class=\"transparency\"></div><div class=\"modal-popup\"><div class=\"popup js-modal-popup-container\"></div></div></div><script>\n//<![CDATA[\n\n      $(document).ready(function(){\n        GaTrackPage.track('');\n      });\n    \n//]]>\n</script><div style=\"display: none; visibility: hidden;\">\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">var google_tag_params={job_id:\"REPLACE_WITH_VALUE\",job_locid:\"REPLACE_WITH_VALUE\",job_pagetype:\"REPLACE_WITH_VALUE\",job_totalvalue:\"REPLACE_WITH_VALUE\"};</script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">var google_conversion_id=944653793,google_custom_params=window.google_tag_params,google_remarketing_only=!0;</script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"//www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion.js\"></script><iframe name=\"google_conversion_frame\" title=\"Google conversion frame\" width=\"300\" height=\"13\" src=\"https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/944653793/?random=1492827453935&amp;cv=8&amp;fst=1492827453935&amp;num=1&amp;fmt=1&amp;guid=ON&amp;u_h=1024&amp;u_w=1280&amp;u_ah=1024&amp;u_aw=1280&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_his=1&amp;u_tz=-300&amp;u_java=false&amp;u_nplug=0&amp;u_nmime=0&amp;data=job_id%3DREPLACE_WITH_VALUE%3Bjob_locid%3DREPLACE_WITH_VALUE%3Bjob_pagetype%3DREPLACE_WITH_VALUE%3Bjob_totalvalue%3DREPLACE_WITH_VALUE&amp;frm=0&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.startwire.com%2Flogin&amp;tiba=Job%20Search%20Organization%20%26%20Job%20Application%20Status%20Updates%20%7C%20StartWire\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" vspace=\"0\" hspace=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n<noscript></noscript>\n</div></body>"}
