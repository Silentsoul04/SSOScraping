become wealthy in the process.\n<br><br>\nTo make money in today's economic climate, you need an edge. A way to leverage information into cash at the speed of light. \n<br><br>\n<strong>A purely scientific and proven method of predicting market behavior that is seldom, if ever, wrong.</strong>\n<br><br>\nMy Name is <strong>Nicola Delic</strong> and today I want to share with you a method for becoming wealthy unlike any you have ever seen.\n<br><br>\nA powerful new approach to trading which utilizes <strong>Nano-Signal Trading Technology ™</strong> and something I can only refer to publicly as Signal X. It’s a cash producing combination that could make you more money, faster and easier, than anything ever has.\n<br><br>\nYou can be sure that no one else has this information, <strong>because I discovered it and I will only share this with a few people who are serious about becoming wealthy with me.</strong>\n<br><br>\nHere are a few things you should know right up front: \n<br><br>\n<ul style=\"margin:0 0 0 50px; font-weight:bold;\" class=\"mobi-massive\">\n\t<li style=\"list-style-image:none; list-style-type:disc;\">\n\t\tI won't be sharing this information anywhere on the Internet. It will be delivered to your door in a carefully prepared package. \n\t</li>\n\t<br>\n\t<li style=\"list-style-image:none; list-style-type:disc;\">\n\t\tOnly a controlled, limited number, of Scientific Trading Machine packages will ever be released. \n\t</li>\n\t<br>\n\t<li style=\"list-style-image:none; list-style-type:disc;\">\n\t\tYou must agree never to share the secret with anyone else. This information is for my private group only. \n\t</li><br>\n\t<li style=\"list-style-image:none; list-style-type:disc;\">\n\t\tNothing will be held back. Not only will I share the Scientific Trading Machine system with you, but I’ll also share the knowledge I've gained from helping thousands of people learn how to trade Forex. This information is vital because I now know the fastest way to get a complete beginner up and trading in days. \n\t</li>\n\t<br>\n\t<li style=\"list-style-image:none; list-style-type:disc;\">\n\t\tThis small group of trading aces will have exclusive access to my private members' area. This is a confidential area where I can share ideas and work with my group. \n\t</li>\n\t<br>\n\t<li style=\"list-style-image:none; list-style-type:disc;\">\n\t\tLike any good teacher, I only want the very best for my students. Anyone who manages to get in today has my personal assurance that I will be there for them every step of the way. \n\t</li>\n\t<br>\n\t<li style=\"list-style-image:none; list-style-type:disc;\">\n\t\tMy commitment is that only the people who become part of this small group today will ever know this secret.\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\nMy dilemma has always been whether to share or keep the secret I have discovered. However, I have received so many messages from people who follow me on Facebook and other social media who <strong>really need a little help to get back on their feet</strong> that I just couldn't ignore it anymore. \n<br><br>\nThe hundreds of emails I get from people who want to know how I trade with such accuracy, and make more money trading for just a few hours each day than most make in a month, all ask me one thing: Show me how I can do it too. \n<br><br>\nBut here's the truth. I know, as a consultant, mentor and teacher that if you give the student the answer without teaching them how to work it out for themselves, they eventually fail when they have to do it by themselves. \n<br><br>\nThat's why I am going to keep the number of people who I will share my powerful formula with small. I think the people who act fast, and make a decision today, are probably the right type of people for this amazing wealth-building gift. \n<br><br>\n<strong>Let me just say that there are things I have uncovered about trading Forex profitably that I have never seen in a book or on the Internet.</strong>\n<br><br>\n<strong>I have always looked at trading scientifically.</strong> If I couldn't repeat the result, then it just wasn't scientific. For example, no matter the time frame, price almost always retraces to a certain point. I managed to measure that point with such accuracy that my trading was profitable from that day on. And that's just the beginning. \n<br><br>\nTo be honest, <strong>anyone can master this.</strong> you don't need to know any maths or complicated formulas. It's all common sense if you really look at it. \n<br><br>\nI wanted to be sure this could work for you even if you are just starting out and have little time or money.\n<br><br>\nSo, I have been trading it on a small account, trading very conservatively with small lots sizes and minimal risk. The results on the statement below are something you could easily do your first month trading the system.\n<br><br>\n<center>\n<img src=\"images/week_img.png\" alt=\"Scientific Trading Machine\">\n<br><br>\n<!--<iframe src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/93lk3n324kj45/images/2705_statement.jpg\" style=\"width:860px; height:500px;\" name=\"internal\"></iframe>-->\n<iframe name=\"internal\" style=\"width:820px; height:500px;\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/93lk3n324kj45/images/3063_statement.jpg\"></iframe>\n</center>\n<br>\nI never thought it was that special until other traders started freaking out about my results. <strong>They said my trading was the closest thing to owning a cash machine they had ever seen.</strong> I must say, it did change my life, and I think it can change the lives of other people too, but only if they manage to get a copy of my secret.\n<br><br>\n<strong>What makes this method different, and more accurate than anything that has come before it, is something I call Nano-Signal Trading Technology ™ and an even more surprising discovery which I will refer to here as signal X.</strong>\n<br><br>\n<!-- <strong><span style=\"background:#FFFF00;\">Video of the technology here</span></strong>\n<br /><br /> -->\nThis system has been rigorously and thoroughly tested.

As other traders on the stock exchange braced for a British loss, he knew better and went long.

And do it safely in a 100% liquid market that is practically \"crisis-proof?\"\n<br><br>\n<strong>You see, when you trade the currency market (Forex), there is always the potential to make money, regardless of how good or bad the economy is... And make the kinds of returns that traditional investors would kill for. </strong>\n<br><br>\nLook, let's say the worst happened and a major economic power took another recession nose-dive... Traditional investors would start playing the \"safe\" game again and pull their money out.<strong> The stock market would crash, and anyone who was in for the long haul could lose everything... </strong>\n<br><br>\nEven if you tried to liquidate your funds quickly, you would have to jump through so many hoops, you would likely lose most of your investment before you could cash in.\n<br><br>\n<strong>But when you are trading currencies, you can instantly take your money out or shift your funds from one currency to another, and no matter which one is down, another one is always up! </strong>\n<br><br>\nAnd it is in trading those currency pairs, trading their exchange rate, that <strong>people like me and you have made fortunes... And much faster and easier than you might think! </strong>\n<br><br>\nSomething I have learned is that <strong>EARNING MONEY</strong> is hard. I don't care if you are a construction worker, a taxi cab driver, or the CEO of a Fortune 500 company.\n<br><br>\n\n<strong style=\"font-size: 24px; color: rgb(0, 0, 255); text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px rgb(204, 204, 204); width: 640px; display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;\" class=\"sales-page-24\">\nTrading your time for money is a hard way to go...\n</strong>\n\n<br><br>\n<strong>MAKING MONEY on the other hand is far easier...</strong> When you know how.\n<br><br>\nAnd the ONE THING I know for certain is that times are getting tougher all around the globe.

But those days are OVER!\n</strong>\n</center>\n<br>\n<strong>I am about to help you to take that power back and give you an unfair advantage over even the big dogs.</strong>\n<br><br>\n<strong>Information has <em>always</em> been at the heart of profitable trading...</strong>\n<br><br>\nAnother quick story to demonstrate the power of having the right information at the right time...\n<br><br>\nThe GBP (British Pound) was first electronically traded outside Europe via telegraph in 1858. And for that momentous occasion to occur, scores of scientists, engineers, and technicians had to spend nearly a decade in development. And it took eight long years of attempts to make it happen. \n<br><br>\nThe man with the foresight to finally make it happen was named Mr. Fields. Mr. Fields was a money-man and he saw the instant financial potential in exploiting the brand-new science of electrical engineering. \n<br><br>\nIn fact, when Morse successfully tested his new dot and dash method of \"instant communication,\" Fields understood instantly that he had found a way to \"bring the world to America's shores\" through the newly harnessed power of electricity. \n<br><br>\nThis was over 160 years before we developed \"Bluetooth\" technology, so the only way Fields and Morse could bring the miracle of \"instant\" communications across the ocean was through a hard cable. And that meant someone had to create a cable that could conduct huge amounts of current, carrying thousands of signals, and could be used with Morse's technology to send and decode those signals across the Atlantic Ocean. \n<br><br>\nFields and Morse spent years developing their Transatlantic Cable, and years more convincing Queen Victoria to put England's trust in this untried idea... \n<br><br>\nAfter five failed attempts to splice hundreds of thousands of feet of cable, on August 5, 1858 they finally succeeded and \"instant\" transcontinental communication was born! \n<br><br>\n<strong>To this day in finance circles, the British Pound is called the Cable</strong> because it was the first foreign currency traded in the United States via electronics! \n<br><br>\nWhether Fields knew it or not, he was laying the groundwork for international currency exchange via electronic Forex trading... It is his fundamental idea that I have in part build my Scientific Trading Machine on <strong>because getting instantaneous and accurate information can mean the difference between making a no money and a lot of money. </strong>\n<br><br>\nSo anyway, once the Cable was established, Buffalo in \"Upstate New York\" became the home of many of the brand-new millionaires who were minted thanks to this instantaneous information. \n<br><br>\nMen like banker George L. Williams built palatial homes along Delaware Avenue, known as \"Millionaire's Row,\" and spared no expense. <strong>When the Williams mansion was built, it was the single most expensive home in Buffalo... at $171,877.00. That's $4,784,004.35 in today's dollars! </strong>\n<br><br>\n<center>\n<strong style=\"font-size: 24px; color: rgb(0, 0, 255); text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px rgb(204, 204, 204); width: 640px; display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;\" class=\"sales-page-24\">\nThat is the kind of \"Immortal Wealth\" instant \n\ninformation made possible even back then... \n\nAnd with the Scientific Trading Machine you \n\nnow get the information you need to make \n\nmoney in a Nanosecond.\n</strong>\n<br><br>\n<iframe name=\"internal\" style=\"width:860px; height:500px;\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/93lk3n324kj45/images/stm-statement-1.jpg\"></iframe>\n\n</center>\n<br>\n<br>\n<center>\n<strong style=\"font-size: 24px; color:#CC0000; text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px rgb(204, 204, 204); width: 640px; display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;\" class=\"sales-page-24\">\nProceed With Caution...

I believe if you measure something, it generally improves. The fact that you pay attention to it, observe it, gives you a deeper understanding of it and you can't help but get better at it. </strong>\n<br><br>\nYou see, I don't believe in luck or good fortune. I think that having a deep understanding about something, and succeeding at it, takes research and testing.\n<br><br>\nIt's been like that with trading for me. I never understood why some people would start trading before knowing the first thing about what they were doing. Even when I was starting out, I was careful to make sure I fully understood a system before I began trading it. <strong>The system you use is your most important tool. </strong>\n<br><br>\nMy path to this new scientific trading breakthrough started in middle school... When I first started learning to code. \n<br><br>\nYou've probably heard a lot about coding, how it is the skill of the future. It is. <strong>Knowing the language of computers and creating applications that have them doing the hard work for us is probably the most important \"knowledge work\" on the planet. </strong>\n<br><br>\n<!--I started coding when I was just thirteen years old, a decade before you could sign up for a class somewhere to learn it. I worked with computer experts and learned the language of computing from the ground up. \n<br /><br />\n<strong>What used to be just 1s and 0s is now complex code, and is the key to unlocking any door, especially financial ones, anywhere in the world. </strong>\n<br /><br />\nNow, I'm not talking about hacking here, although I could have easily gone that route... <strong>I'm talking about developing instant, computerized scientific applications that boil hundreds of years of data and thousands of hours of complex theory into the work of seconds.</strong> \n<br /><br />\nThat is what I learned to do. And as soon as my skill at coding became well-known, I was recruited, at the young age of just 17, to start creating software for the finance industry. \n<br /><br />\nA fleet of special \"tutors\" in finance were lined up for me so that I could learn all of the complex trading theory that most people had an MBA to learn... \n<br /><br />\nAnd with each new piece of information, each trading approach that I learned, I could not only create software to do it for the bankers, but to <strong>improve on it so that even the advanced theories were easier to understand and to use. </strong>\n<br /><br />\nBy the time I was 19, I was obsessed with taking the concept of instantaneous communication-the science of mathematics and computing-and using it to dominate the financial world. \n<br /><br />\nWhile I am not so comfortable tooting my own horn, I did it. I created applications that made my bosses very, very wealthy and within just a few years, I opened my own hedge fund.\n<br /><br />\nYou may have heard what happened next. The moment I opened my fund it was over-subscribed, and I had to turn people away, and within months, I had grown it to over $10 million. \n<br /><br />\nNow, I have \"retired\" from that fund and spend my time on my yacht or one of my homes, trading when I want and making thousands of dollars to advise my old hedge fund bosses on how to make their clients even more money.\n<br /><br />\nBut the thing I enjoy, more than anything, is helping other traders succeed. There is no better feeling than watching someone who has struggled, sometimes for years, finally start making good consistent money just about every time they trade.\n<br /><br />-->\n<strong>The Scientific Trading Machine is the culmination of everything I have learned and tested over the past decade. I have spent countless hours and more money than a I care to admit perfecting this.</strong>\n<br><br>\nEverything that came before it, including Elliot Wave Theory, make up a part of this system. I tirelessly worked to find the most profitable elements of every method and meld them into the ultimate system.\n<br><br>\n<!-- <strong>(7 ease of use)</strong>\n<br /><br /> -->\n<center>\n<strong style=\"font-size: 24px; color: rgb(0, 0, 255); text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px rgb(204, 204, 204); width: 640px; display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;\" class=\"sales-page-24\">\n\"The Secret of the Mystery Signal Revealed!\"\n</strong>\n</center>\n<br>\nIn my studies, I was able to find a signal that is so rare – and so carefully guarded – that when I announced my discovery, some of my biggest clients tried to swear <u>me</u> to secrecy.\n<br><br>\n<strong>And it's partly this secret that has my old hedge fund colleagues paying me as much as $25,000 to learn.</strong>\n<br><br>\nYou see, this technological advantage is something traders at the highest level of finance, and their multi-billion-dollar clients, have been searching for, for decades, in order to amass enormous wealth...\n<br><br>\nAnd it's no carrier pigeon! \n<br><br>\n<strong>Today, with Scientific Trading Machine, the mystery of their unfair advantage is yours.</strong> With STM, you get instant use of and confirmation of the rarest of chart signals...  \n<br><br>\n<strong>This signal is so specific, so accurate, and so highly protected that I cannot name it here.

Which is the only way to compete with the \"big dogs\" on Wall Street. \n<br><br>\nThen Signal X and all the custom indicators keep working for you, so you get just as clear a signal for when to get out and with the most cash you can. \n<br><br>\n<strong>\"Keeping the cash\" is the single most important strategy for any trader.</strong> It isn't about chasing the \"Moby Dick\" trade, it's about keeping all the cash you can... <strong>It's about not losing. </strong>\n<br><br>\n<strong>In fact, where Scientific Trading Machine shines is how effective it is at reducing and removing risk.</strong> I've designed it so that many of the indicators do \"double duty.\" They multi-task so you get solid signals to get into the market, and the same kind of solid, layer-on-layer confirmation that it's time to get out. \n<br><br>\n<strong>And you get those same exit signals, even for a losing trade, with the same Nano-Signal Trading technology – the same billionth of a second speed – so you can move your stop to minimize your risk, often by as much as 80%, or even break even so a \"loss\" costs you nothing! </strong>\n<br><br>\nThe world doesn't stop anymore for anything, and even when your preferred market is closed, someone else's is open. All that information feeds straight into your ticker and is calculated instantly for your control center and indicators. \n<br><br>\n<strong>So, you have an instant worldwide market picture and can trade any market, anywhere in the world</strong> that you can get an account... And because the system itself is based on solid mechanical and technical trading principles, <strong>you can trade all those markets, pairs, and time frames with complete confidence. </strong>\n<br><br>\nWhen I say \"Signal X\" is the \"secret sauce,\" I don't mean that it's some crazy black box thing. It's really just some science, some high-level math done at light speed by the software, and good old-fashioned common sense. \n<br><br>\n<strong>It's the science that makes Signal X special and unlike anything you have seen in Forex trading before. </strong>\n<br><br>\nMaybe it's because I was a math whiz in school and got hired for my first high finance gig at 17 that I'm always looking for the solution to the \"big question:\" How I or <u><em>anyone</em></u> could trade for the kinds of profits the professionals do, and do it faster, easier, and for a lot of money? \n<br><br>\nIn math, we call it \"solving for X.\" So when my experiments and research found the answer, there was no better name for it than \"Signal X\" because everyone who has used it has greatly improved their trading.\n<br><br>\n<center>\n<strong style=\"font-size: 24px; color: rgb(0, 0, 255); text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px rgb(204, 204, 204); width: 640px; display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;\" class=\"sales-page-24\">\n\"In Today's Market, The Only Signal Worth Anything Is \n\nConstant And  Continual – Updated Live In Real Time – With Zero Lag, And The Ability To Act \n\nOn That Signal Instantly\"\n</strong>\n</center>\n<br>\nLook, success all boils down to three things for any trader: \n<br><br>\n<ul style=\"margin:0 0 0 50px;\" class=\"mobi-massive\">\n\t<li style=\"list-style-image:url(https://s3.amazonaws.com/93lk3n324kj45/images/tick_grn_li.png); list-style-type:none;\">\n\t\t Time\n\t</li>\n\t<br>\n\t<li style=\"list-style-image:url(https://s3.amazonaws.com/93lk3n324kj45/images/tick_grn_li.png); list-style-type:none;\">\n\t\t Risk\n\t</li>\n\t<br>\n\t<li style=\"list-style-image:url(https://s3.amazonaws.com/93lk3n324kj45/images/tick_grn_li.png); list-style-type:none;\">\n\t\t Profits\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\nWhat any successful trader needs is: \n<br><br>\n<ul style=\"margin:0 0 0 50px;\" class=\"mobi-massive\">\n\t<li style=\"list-style-image:none; list-style-type:disc;\">\n\t\tScientific analysis so they get in and out of positions, fast, and with the most cash.\n\t</li>\n\t<br>\n\t<li style=\"list-style-image:none; list-style-type:disc;\">\n\t\tTo <u>know they won't lose their shirts when a trade goes south</u> because the real secret to trading like a pro isn't looking for a big score, it's making sure you limit your losses, to keep your profits where they belong...

No way. \n<br><br>\nA signal service is a monthly subscription where you receive daily, sometimes hourly, updates on trend movements... And you can pay anywhere from $30 to hundreds a month for them. \n<br><br>\nFive years ago an hourly update might have worked, but with the advent of fully automated trading (robots), a divergence trend or flash crash (becoming more and more common), would have already happened by the time you got the information... Leaving you holding a big empty bag. \n<br><br>\nSo you keep paying, and paying, and paying for outdated information and data that is already too old to make you any money. In fact, the only people getting rich from signal services are the guys selling them! \n<br><br>\n<strong>What's the alternative then?</strong> For most retail traders, the only alternative is to sit in front of their charts all day, every day, watching five live news feeds, and constantly flipping chart tabs, scanning for trend shifts on multiple pairs and time frames.\n<br><br>\nNo one has time for that! <strong>I guarantee you that none of the top 5% of traders who are getting rich are \"plugged in\" 24/7. </strong>\n<br><br>\n<strong>Most of us spend an hour or two, at most, actually trading.</strong> We spend the rest of our time living our lives, loving our families, pursuing our passions... And we make money... Lots and lots of money. \n<br><br>\n<strong>How do we do it?</strong> Like Rothschild before us, we use the latest and most up to date technology for true instant communication. <strong>We get our signals live, in real time, along with all the news and a few other factors that most retail traders don't realize might drive the market, but we do. </strong>\n<br><br>\nAnd we don't get them from monthly signal services. \n<br><br>\n<!--One trader I know traded either side of the GBP \"flash crash\" to make thousands in one day, without a robot, and without going blind on charts. She simply waited for the signal, got in, got out, and made more money in about an hour's work than some people make in a month. \n<br /><br />\nAnd several more traded the most recent DOW crash with this same kind of instant signal technology, making as much as $9,200.00 in a single day. \n<br /><br />\nAnd each one of these traders had one thing in common. <strong>They were trading with instant market communication. </strong>\n<br /><br />-->\n<center>\n<strong style=\"font-size: 24px; color: rgb(0, 0, 255); text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px rgb(204, 204, 204); width: 640px; display: inline-block; max-width: 100%;\" class=\"sales-page-24\">\n\"No one has ever integrated all of this critical \n\ninformation, plus 'Signal X,' into one highly \n\nprofitable, fast, and incredibly simple system: \n\nNano-Signal Trading Technology™, until today.\"\n</strong>\n</center>\n<br>\nAnd no other technology takes into account every currency fluctuation, news event, and micro-trend that professionals like me need to have at a glance to make millions.

Is Scientific Trading Machine REALLY different or is it the same as all the other systems in a shiny new wrapper? </strong>\n<br><br>\n<strong style=\"color:#009900; font-size:24px;\">A:</strong> I promise you that <strong>you have never seen a system remotely similar to this. It is an entirely new way to trade.</strong> However, the only way you are going to believe that is to see it, and trade it, for yourself. <strong>So use it for 60 days before you decide to keep it.</strong> If it is not the easiest to trade and most profitable system you have ever seen, or even if you just don't like it for any reason, or no reason at all... \n<br><br>\nJust send it back for a no hassle, no-questions-asked-refund. \n<br><br>\n<strong><strong style=\"color:#CC0000; font-size:24px;\">Q:</strong> Can someone new trading learn this system?</strong>\n<br><br>\n<strong style=\"color:#009900; font-size:24px;\">A:</strong> I get this question a lot. <strong>Absolutely,</strong> a new trader can learn this trading system and it won't even take long. There is actually an advantage to being a new trader. They don't have bad habits or preconceived notions that make learning something new difficult. Of course, there is a bit of a learning curve. However, it's really quite simple and I will teach you everything you need to know in the members' area. Plus, we have a trader on-call 24/7 to answer questions and regular webinars to help you understand everything quickly. <strong>Even if you have never traded before we will have you trading like a pro in no time. </strong>\n<br><br>\n<strong><strong style=\"color:#CC0000; font-size:24px;\">Q:</strong> A lot of systems seem complicated... Will I be able to do this? </strong>\n<br><br>\n<strong style=\"color:#009900; font-size:24px;\">A:</strong> The rules of the <strong>Scientific Trading Machine</strong> are very easy to follow. That's why I can recommend it for new traders also. And really that's the secret to success with this system or any good system. Following the rules. <strong>Everything is laid out in an easy-to-follow, step-by-step fashion.</strong> Aside from the numerous examples and live trades to show you how to apply the simple rules, I will also be available to answer any questions and help you understand how to trade the system better. <strong>What makes Scientific Trading Machine so much better than other systems is that it does all the hard work for you.</strong> Really once you understand it, and set it up, which is easy, it finds trades for you almost on autopilot. <strong>It's probably the least complicated system to trade ever made. </strong>\n<br><br>\n<strong><strong style=\"color:#CC0000; font-size:24px;\">Q:</strong> Can I trade Scientific Trading Machine with a full time job? </strong>\n<br><br>\n<strong style=\"color:#009900; font-size:24px;\">A:</strong> <strong>Yes, you can!</strong> One of the reasons I created this system is that I don't want to spend as much time trading as I used to. And I know that people with full-time jobs have very little time to spend trading. <strong>This is something you can do, and make good money at, in just 60 minutes per day a few days a week.</strong> I understand that most new traders, and even those who have been trading for a while now, do so while holding down a full-time job. \n<br><br>\n<strong>It is a part-time trader's dream come true</strong> because it finds profitable setups for you. All you need to do is hit \"yes\" when the indicators tell you to. You can do that while you are watching the news on TV or helping the kids with their homework. \n<br><br>\n<strong><strong style=\"color:#CC0000; font-size:24px;\">Q:</strong> Will Scientific Trading Machine work on any charting software? </strong>\n<br><br>\n<strong style=\"color:#009900; font-size:24px;\">A:</strong> The method can only be traded using the free MetaTrader4 platform. If you are a new trader or you have not used this platform before, I will show you exactly how to use it. The MetaTrader 4 trading software is free and very easy to use, that's why it is the preferred platform of many traders. \n<br><br>\n<strong><strong style=\"color:#CC0000; font-size:24px;\">Q:</strong> What is the Win/Loss Ratio? </strong>\n<br><br>\n<strong style=\"color:#009900; font-size:24px;\">A:</strong> On average, I normally <strong>win at least +/- 80% of the time</strong> using the <strong>Scientific Trading Machine,</strong> but this percentage may vary from trader to trader. The important thing to remember is that I show you how to keep your winners big and losers small. <strong>So even if you lose half your trades, you could still make plenty of money. </strong>\n<br><br>\n<strong><strong style=\"color:#CC0000; font-size:24px;\">Q:</strong> What time of day can I trade with the system? </strong>\n<br><br>\n<strong style=\"color:#009900; font-size:24px;\">A:</strong> <strong>You can trade whenever the Scientific Trading Machine alerts you to a signal, no matter the time day or night. There are times you won't want to trade, and the custom indicators will tell you when to take a trade and when not to. </strong>\n<br><br>\nWe also cover not trading around things like big news announcements and such in the members' area. <strong>For the most part though, there is almost always an opportunity to take good trades and make money. </strong>\n<br><br>\n<strong><strong style=\"color:#CC0000; font-size:24px;\">Q:</strong> What currency pairs can I trade? </strong>\n<br><br>\n<strong style=\"color:#009900; font-size:24px;\">A:</strong> <strong>Scientific Trading Machine</strong> will work well on any currency pair. <strong>The beauty is that the Control Panel will tell you at a glance which pairs are hot opportunities to make some quick cash. </strong>\n<br><br>\n<strong><strong style=\"color:#CC0000; font-size:24px;\">Q:</strong> How much money do I need to get started? </strong>\n<br><br>\n<strong style=\"color:#009900; font-size:24px;\">A:</strong> To get started, <strong>I would suggest no money at all.</strong> Trade on a demo account and prove that you are comfortable with the system and that you can make regular profits. Once you do decide to go live, start with the smallest amount possible your broker could offer, like a micro account of even as little as $100 for example. Never trade with money you cannot afford to lose, see the CAUTION at the end of this page. <strong>This is not a get-rich-quick scheme. However it is a path to real long term wealth.</strong> Just be sensible and use common sense. You could grow your account very quickly with this once you get comfortable with it. So <strong>unless you have some experience, and money set aside for trading, start small and watch it grow. It could happen faster than you think. </strong>\n<br><br>\n<strong><strong style=\"color:#CC0000; font-size:24px;\">Q:</strong> Is there a monthly subscription or is it a one-time fee? </strong>\n<br><br>\n<strong style=\"color:#009900; font-size:24px;\">A:</strong> <strong>It is a one time, all-inclusive fee. The Scientific Trading Machine</strong> package, which includes the 4 DVDs, the trading manual, unlimited access to the members' area for a minimum of 6 months, the live and recorded webinars and all the bonuses, are all for a <strong>one-time only</strong> fee. <strong>You will never need to purchase anything additional ever! </strong>\n<br><br>\n<strong><strong style=\"color:#CC0000; font-size:24px;\">Q:</strong> Is Scientific Trading Machine a trading robot or a manual trading strategy? </strong>\n<br><br>\n<strong style=\"color:#009900; font-size:24px;\">A:</strong> It is a manual trading system. <strong>In fact, it is as 100% mechanical as a system gets.</strong> It does use advanced custom indicators and a Control Panel that semi-automates trading. However, the decision on when to enter the trade is always that of the trader, so <strong>at all times you remain completely in control of your money. </strong>\n<br><br>\n<strong><strong style=\"color:#CC0000; font-size:24px;\">Q:</strong> Is Scientific Trading Machine a trend following or a trend reversal system? </strong>\n<br><br>\n<strong style=\"color:#009900; font-size:24px;\">A:</strong> The trend is your friend is a cliche for a reason. It's 100% true. That said, you will learn some secrets for taking cash out of the market when others would not see a trade at all. This system finds cash in places no one else would even think to look. \n<br><br>\n<strong><strong style=\"color:#CC0000; font-size:24px;\">Q:</strong> Why are you selling Scientific Trading Machine? </strong>\n<br><br>\n<strong style=\"color:#009900; font-size:24px;\">A:</strong> This may sound like B.S. but it's just how it is. I know how well this system works, how easy it makes trading, and to not share it would be really selfish of me. <strong>I was right where you are and I would have killed or died for something that actually worked.</strong> This does. I make a lot more from trading in a week besides the tiny percentage I will make off the sales of this. <strong>But I will take that money, put it in my account, and double it many times over using Scientific Trading Machine :) </strong>\n<br><br>\n<strong><strong style=\"color:#CC0000; font-size:24px;\">Q:</strong> Is Scientific Trading Machine a scalping, intraday, or swing trading method? </strong>\n<br><br>\n<strong style=\"color:#009900; font-size:24px;\">A:</strong> It is all of the above. It can absolutely be used to scalp the 5 minute and even the 1 minute time frames, but you can also use it very effectively on the 4 hour, daily or weekly time frames. <strong>The system works on every time frame. </strong>\n<br><br>\n<strong><strong style=\"color:#CC0000; font-size:24px;\">Q:</strong> How many trades a day can I expect with Scientific Trading Machine? </strong>\n<br><br>\n<strong style=\"color:#009900; font-size:24px;\">A:</strong> This depends on a few different things: the timeframe you trade, how many pairs you trade, your time for trading, and lastly, but maybe the most important point, based on the market behavior or how the market is moving at the time. You can expect more trading setups on lower timeframes than on higher ones. \n<br><br>\nThat said,<strong> I am a strong believer that it's not the number of trades you take, but rather the quality of the trades you take, that makes you rich. </strong>\n<br><br>\nI will show you how to take fewer trades and makes lots more money by doing so. <strong>That way you can trade less than others do, and make lots more money. </strong>\n<br><br>\n<strong>REMEMBER:</strong> If you take the 2-Payment option ($650 X 2), you will never need to make another payment once you have covered the price of the system. You receive all the benefits of a one-time payment of $997. Either payment option will give you access to the full course and the members' area for 6 months. Your training will start tomorrow, and above and beyond everything I have mentioned, you will also receive specially prepared video training until your course arrives. You will receive some very special bonuses during the next weeks and months if you act today. \n<br><br>\n<center>\n\t<strong class=\"sales-page-24\" style=\"color:#000000; font-size:28px; text-shadow:#CCCCCC 1px 1px 1px;\">\n\tCAUTION\n\t</strong>\n\t</center>\n\t<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:14px; color:#666666;\">\n\tHYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS HAVE MANY INHERENT LIMITATIONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE DESCRIBED BELOW.
