When you sign up for KH Media LLC’s website, you will note that there are two main types of service memberships that you can sign up for. The first is the standard account, and the second is the premium membership. If you have chosen to maintain a standard profile, then you will NOT be asked to pay for any of the services that you have access to.  That being said, KH Media LLC still keeps your credit card information on file in case you upgrade or purchase any of the available services that are on the website. If you decide to upgrade to the premium membership service at any point; that is when you will have a recurring monthly fee that will accrue on your Payment Type. When you start using a Premium membership service for the site, and by agreeing to utilize all of the different benefits that the Site offers, you are also in agreement that you will allow KH Media LLC and those who work with them to make the appropriate charges (both for the monthly plan and any related taxes and fees) to your Payment Type so that you can continue with your membership benefits. KH Media LLC will charge your Payment Type in whatever intervals you have chosen (every month, every 3 months, every 6 months, etc), on what is referred to as the renewal date of your plan, until you have decided to terminate your use of the KH Media LLC site, or KH Media LLC has terminated your account.\nTo put it in perspective; if you decide to start doing a membership plan, and you started the Premium Membership on the 17th of December, then you will recur the charges on the 17th of every month; on that day, your Payment Type will be charged the appropriate amount for your monthly payments. If you had started your account on a day that does not exist in every month (for example, the 31st of May), then what will happen is that your Payment Type will be charged on the first day of the month after (for example, if you started on the 31st of May, and you were renewing in June, the renewal date would be July 1st instead, since there is no June 31st). You should note that you are not going to be given any sort of receipt or slip that shows that you have been paying these costs on a recurring basis. That being said, you also agree that you are going to pay any and all of the premium service fees (including any taxes), in regards to the Payment Type that you are using to pay your KH Media LLC monthly account fees. You also agree to pay any other costs that you may incur that are pertaining to your KH Media LLC account.\n<h2>Pending Charges for Payment Cards.</h2>\nShould your Payment Type be a credit card or charge card of any type, you also are permitting KH Media LLC to make a pending fee to your current Payment Type the moment that you enroll in the membership, and before each repeated monthly charge. Pending fees are only there to ensure that your Payment Type is still valid and that you are still using the same billing address; these fees do not actually get charged to the card at all; instead, they are taken off after a few days’ time. Pending fees, while they are still pending, may still reduce the amount of credit that you have available for your use (it’s usually approximately $1 for each fee you have waiting).\n<h2>Fees which are Connected to your Payment Method.</h2>\nWhen you are utilizing a Payment Type, you are the one who is responsible for any type of fee that is invoiced to the card by the company that has issued your card. These fees may include any service fees, limit penalties, overdraft preventions, monthly credit card fees, and over your credit limit fees, depending on the provider and your particular credit account.\n<h2>Promotional Offers.</h2>\nOn occasion, in KH Media LLC’s discretion, the KH Media LLC may decide to offer reduced subscription fees, either to those who are just signing up for the website, or for certain customers who have been on the website for a period of time. If you decide to utilize one of these offers, your Payment Method will be charged the promotional amount (including taxes and other possible fees) after you have completed registration for the site (or signing up for the offer, if you are already a customer. For any of these offers, you are understanding that the promotional cost is only going to applied to your account during the period that has been specified; when the promotional period has ended, you will be charged the standard amount on a recurring monthly basis (unless you have canceled your account). Every promotion that the website offers is different, and may include different costs and durations depending on the promotion that is being offered. The details that are related to the offer that you have taken may not be covered in the Terms and Conditions; if that is the case, then you will see an explanation of those details when you register for the site. KH Media LLC has the right to give promotional access to various other sites, and to selected subscribers to KH Media LLC’s site or other sites.\n<h2>trials.</h2>\nOccasionally, KH Media LLC will also offer trials to those who are trying the website for the first time. This usually has limits of some sort (one per household and/or Payment Type is usually the standard). Even though it is a trials trial, the customer is still required to provide their credit card information during registration – the card will be approved in that time, but it won’t be charged at all. If there are other terms of these offers, including the period of time that the trials trial lasts, those can vary based on the promotion. Any details not covered in the Terms and Conditions are presented to you when you sign up for the website. The trials trial will start the day that you subscribe to the KH Media LLC subscription.\nOnce your trials trial has ended, your registration to the website will renew automatically. Payments will be made on the same day every month, or as indicated by what you agreed to as part of your registration process. These automatic payments will continue, until you have made the decision to terminate them, no matter how long the trials trial period may have been. It is recommended that you take note; the prices that you pay may be different, depending on what device you are using, what service(s) you are paying for, and the country that you currently reside it. It may also differ based on promotions and offers as well. After your trials trial has ended, that first day, your Payment Type will be invoiced, and that will become your renewal date for the future recurring monthly costs and applicable taxes that are related to the service plan that you agreed to. This will happen, unless you cancel it before the trials trial period has ended. If you do not cancel the monthly package before the trials trial period has completed, then you WILL BE CHARGED for a month of service via your Payment Type. Take note: the KH Media LLC will not notify you to let you know that your trials trial period is about to end. Because of this, KH Media LLC recommends that you keep track of the trials trial’s expiration date for your own records and related purposes.\nWhile the trials trial is still in effect, you will have access to all of the benefits that KH Media LLC has available through their online services, with no charge to you. The monthly subscription fees may be terminated or changed at any point in time before your respective trials trial ends. You can do this by calling 1-877-913-9942 for United States and Canadian citizens, or you can call 1-302 327 4042 if you are an international customer of KH Media LLC; this number is available 0AM to 12PM. If you decide to make a change during the period of time in which your trials trial is valid, and before it is completed, the rest of your trials trial will be eliminated and the charge card will be asked to pay the charges for the plan that you have changed to.\n<h2>MEMBERSHIP PLANS BASED ON MEDIA CONENT</h2>\nKH Media LLC, at the time that these Terms and Conditions have been written, offers five different content categories for members: books, online games, movies, music, and a membership that grants access to all four other categories. On occasion, KH Media LLC may also add in other categories for membership content, at their discretion. If a person has registered for one of the specific categories that KH Media LLC offers, they may be given a promotion that allows them to upgrade their plan to the “all access” type for a cost of $2.95 or they may have a promotional cost associated with the upgrade. This will be made known during registration. If a user decides to upgrade, their new membership will follow the previous Terms and Conditions that were applicable during the membership that was signed up for initially, but they will now have access to other areas of the site.\n<h2>Refusal of Fees to Your Payment Card And Expiration Date</h2>\nAs you likely know, credit cards have an expiration date. If the initial expiration date of your Payment Type occurs while you are still subscribed to KH Media LLC’s membership service, and you do not cancel it or change your payment information ahead of time, then KH Media LLC will continue billing the previous Payment Type for your monthly services. In the case that your Payment Type, for any reason, refuses to pay your recurring membership, then there are a few things in place which allow you to possibly continue your membership. For nine days, you are able to rectify the issue, whether it is by updating your current Payment Type’s expiration date or by adding a new Payment Type to your account. If, within that nine day period of time, one of the Payment Types that you have on record with KH Media LLC is able to be charged for your monthly subscription fee, then you will maintain your benefits without interruption and the card will be charged for any and all recurring payments following until your account has been terminated. If, on the tenth day, you have not rectified the issue, then you will lose access to your account until the issue has been rectified. KH Media LLC will attempt to charge a card every 10 days following that 10th day, over a 30 day period of time. Once again, if the card is able to be charged, then your benefits will be reinstated and the date in which your card was able to be charged will become your new monthly renewal date. As above, that card will then be the one that is charged from that point forward, until you have canceled or KH Media LLC has terminated your account.\n<h2>Cancellation by You.</h2>\nThe repeated KH Media LLC Monthly Bundle payment is applicable for the bundle period, beginning on the first day that you have paid your account. The account will remain opened until the following renewal date. For instance, if you choose to have a monthly bundle that starts with a trials trial, and that trials trial ends on the 1st of May, that means that your monthly bundle will begin on May 2nd, and that month of subscription will last until June 1st, when your Payment Type will be asked to pay again for the following period of time (in this case, June 2nd to July 1st). It’s possible, at any point, to cancel your KH Media LLC online bundle, and then you won’t be asked to pay for any subsequent renewals until you start your account back up again. To use the above illustration, if you decided to cancel your membership on June 12th, then you would not be charged on July 1st for the following monthly services. But, you would still have access to your monthly services until July 1st.  This would be the same for any day of the month; so even if you canceled as late as June 30th, you would still only have account access until July 1st. If you are seeking to terminate your monthly subscription, then you can call KH Media LLC at 1-877-913-9942 (Canada and United States), or you can call 1-302 327 4042 if you are an international customer of KH Media LLC.

If you are seeking to modify your monthly subscription, then you can call KH Media LLC at 1-877-913-9942 (Canada and United States), or you can call 1-302 327 4042 if you are an international customer of KH Media LLC.
