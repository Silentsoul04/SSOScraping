If you are representing a company, you will need to enter into a Corporate Client Agreement.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>You should not indicate your agreement to these terms and conditions until you have read them fully, are satisfied that you understand them and are happy with what they say.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Agreement</strong></p>\n\n<p>1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Transacting as an</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Individual</strong>&nbsp;- These terms and conditions apply to private clients (\"you\") who are dealing with OzForex Limited trading as OFX (ABN 65 092 375) 703 (\"us\" or \"we\") as an individual/s through any of our Websites.</p>\n\n<p>1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Ownership of Funds&nbsp;</strong>- You must be the owner of the money you are intending to transfer.</p>\n\n<p>1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Appointment of Agent</strong>&nbsp;- If you would like us to receive instructions from somebody else acting on your behalf, you must sign an Agent Appointment Form.</p>\n\n<p>1.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Structure of this Agreement</strong>&nbsp;- This Agreement is a master agreement which applies to all Transactions you subsequently enter into with us. The specific details of each individual Transaction will be agreed separately at such time as you book those Transactions; they will constitute separate agreements in their own right but will incorporate these terms and conditions.</p>\n\n<p>1.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Other Documents You Must Read</strong>&nbsp;- You acknowledge that you have been provided with copies of the following documents in accordance with, to the extent applicable, the requirements of the Corporations Act:</p>\n\n<p>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Product Disclosure Statement (\"PDS\").<br>\n(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Financial Services Guide (\"FSG\").<br>\n(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Website Use Agreement.<br>\n(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Privacy Statement.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Service</strong></p>\n\n<p>2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Foreign Exchange Services&nbsp;</strong>- We hold an Australian Financial Services Licence authorising us to provide foreign exchange products and services. We offer Spot Contracts (to be settled within 2 days) and Forward Contracts (to be settled between 2 days and 12 months), the details and mechanics of which are explained in our PDS. You should read the PDS before entering into this agreement, so that you understand exactly how our service operates.</p>\n\n<p>2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>No Margin or Speculative Trading</strong>&nbsp;- We do not offer any form of margin or speculative trading facilities. When you enter into a Transaction, you must deliver to us the full amount of the funds you are transferring on or before the Delivery Date.</p>\n\n<p>2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>No Exchange Rate Set-Off</strong>&nbsp;- We will not agree to enter into any kind of set-off arrangement that would allow you to pay us only the amount of any loss that might be realised on settlement of the Transaction, or us to pay you any profit, as the result of exchange rate movements. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>No Financial Advice</strong>&nbsp;- We will not take into account your specific financial circumstances or needs when we enter into a Transaction with you. To the extent that we provide you with any advice, it will relate only to the mechanics of the transaction you are proposing to enter into or to publicly available information. You must obtain your own financial advice and make your own assessment as to whether our service is appropriate for your particular requirements. You must select the type and timing of each Transaction you enter into yourself. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your Instructions</strong></p>\n\n<p>3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Username and Password</strong>&nbsp;- We will issue you with a username and password that will enable you to provide us with Instructions either online, by telephone or by email. It is your responsibility to ensure the security of your username and password. We will rely on any Instructions received pursuant to the use of the username and password without checking the identity of the user and you will at all times be bound by those Instructions.</p>\n\n<p>3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Agent<em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;</em></strong>If you appoint somebody else to act on your behalf (\"Agent\") in accordance with paragraph 1.3, we will act in accordance with all Instructions received from your Agent, and you will be bound by those Instructions, until you withdraw your authority for that Agent. You must give us at least 48 hours written notice of your intention to withdraw your authority for that agent and the authority is only cancelled at the end of that 48 hour period or at such later time as you specify in your notice.</p>\n\n<p>3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>No Obligation to Accept Instructions or Process Transactions</strong>&nbsp;- While we will always endeavour to comply with your Instructions as quickly as possible, there may be circumstances in which we are unable to do so. Therefore, we always reserve the right to refuse to accept your Instructions and to do so without giving you any reasons and without incurring any liability to you for any resultant loss or damages incurred by you or any other party.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transactions</strong></p>\n\n<p>4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Transaction Binding</strong>&nbsp;- If you wish to enter into a Transaction, you may do so by giving us Instructions online, by telephone or by email. The Transaction will be legally binding on you when we receive your Instructions in accordance with this paragraph 4 or paragraph 5.</p>\n\n<p>4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Online Auto Confirm Transaction</strong>&nbsp;- If you enter into an Auto-Confirm Transaction online, the Transaction will be legally binding on you as soon as we receive your electronic Instructions. We will provide you with confirmation of the Transaction Details on the screen at the time you book the Transaction, but we will not provide you with any subsequent confirmation of any kind unless you request it.</p>\n\n<p>4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Online Booking Confirmation</strong>&nbsp;- If you book a Transaction online that is not an Auto-Confirm Transaction, we will attempt to contact you by telephone within 15 minutes of your online booking to confirm the Transaction details. The Transaction will be legally binding on you at the conclusion of the telephone call. If we cannot contact you by telephone on the number you have given to us within 15 minutes, we reserve the right to cancel the booking and not enter into the Transaction.</p>\n\n<p>4.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Email Booking</strong>&nbsp;- It you book a Transaction by email, the Transaction will be binding on you when we process your email. You acknowledge that, if you choose to book a transaction by email, it may not be processed immediately. When we process your Instructions, we will send you an email headed \"Deal Confirmation\". The Deal Confirmation constitutes an error correction mechanism only; if you do not contact us within 24 hours of receipt of the Deal Confirmation, the Transaction details will be deemed to be correct.</p>\n\n<p>4.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Telephone Booking</strong>&nbsp;- If you book a Transaction by telephone, the Transaction will be legally binding at the conclusion of the telephone call. We will send you an email headed \"Deal Confirmation\". The Deal Confirmation constitutes an error correction mechanism only. If there is any discrepancy between the Deal Confirmation and the details of the Transaction that have already been agreed in the telephone conversation, you must contact us within 24 hours of receipt of the Deal Confirmation, failing which the Transaction details in the Deal Confirmation will be deemed to be correct. We record all such telephone calls and in the event of any dispute, the transcript of our telephone conversation may be used as evidence as to the terms of the agreement that was entered into.</p>\n\n<p>4.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Cancellation&nbsp;</strong>- Once a Transaction has become legally binding, you may not cancel the Transaction in any circumstances. You may only take action to correct any of the Transaction details set out in the Deal Confirmation if the Deal Confirmation does not reflect the transaction details that have already been agreed. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>4.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Out-of-Market Quotes&nbsp;</strong>-&nbsp;If we quote you a Rate that is clearly a mistake on our part (\"Out-of-Market Quote\") as the result of a technical or human error, it is not binding on us. You must notify us as soon as the mistake comes to your attention and we will requote the Rate as soon as possible.</p>\n\n<p>4.8<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prompt Performance by You&nbsp;</strong><em>-&nbsp;</em>You acknowledge that exchange rates can fluctuate rapidly, so the Rate we quote you is contingent on the prompt performance of your obligations in relation to that Transaction. We reserve the right to requote the Rate if you do not provide us with requested information or funds on time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forward Transactions</strong></p>\n\n<p>5.1<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forward Contract Details<em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;</em></strong>A Forward Contract can only be requested by telephone and will become legally binding as and from the time that the Transaction details are orally agreed between us in the telephone call. After the telephone call, we will send you a document entitled Deal Confirmation. The Deal Confirmation constitutes an error correction mechanism only. If there is any discrepancy between the Deal Confirmation and the details of the Transaction that have already been agreed in the telephone conversation, you must contact us within 24 hours of receipt of the Deal Confirmation, failing which the Transaction details in the Deal Confirmation will be deemed to be correct. In the event of any dispute, the transcript of our telephone conversation may be used as evidence as to the terms of the agreement that was entered into.</p>\n\n<p>5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Advance Payment&nbsp;</strong>- You acknowledge that we bear the risk that you might default on settlement of your Forward Contract and, to mitigate this settlement risk, we reserve the right to request that you pay one or more Advance Payments in relation to all Forward Contracts. We may request an Advance Payment both at the time you book the Forward Contract and at any time prior to the Maturity Date. The amount of any Advance Payments requested will be a fixed percentage of the value of the Transaction. You acknowledge that the amount of any Advance Payment/s requested will be determined by us in our discretion. For further details on the method of calculating Advance Payments, please see clause 6.6 of the PDS.</p>\n\n<p>5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Failure to Pay an Advance Payment</strong>&nbsp;- If we have asked you to pay an Advance Payment, you must pay the amount we have requested on the date we have nominated. If you do not do so, we reserve the right to Close Out the Forward Contract in accordance with paragraph 9.</p>\n\n<p>5.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Change to the Maturity Date</strong>&nbsp;- You may ask us to bring forward the Maturity Date or to extend the Maturity Date in relation to the whole or only part of your Forward Contract. You acknowledge that we may agree to such a request entirely at our discretion. If we agree, you acknowledge that the Rate will be adjusted to account for the timing of the new settlement date.</p>\n\n<p>5.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Payment of Full Amount on Settlement&nbsp;</strong>- You must transmit to our account the full amount required to settle the Forward Contract, less any Advance Payment already paid, together with any service fees that we [or any third party] have requested, on or before the Maturity Date.</p>\n\n<p><strong>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Payment to Us</strong></p>\n\n<p>6.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Spot Contract Payments</strong>&nbsp;- You must initiate payment into our account of the full amount required to settle a Spot Contract on the day the Transaction becomes legally binding in accordance with paragraph 4. If we have not received the funds within 2 Business Days, we reserve the right to Close Out the Transaction in accordance with paragraph 9.</p>\n\n<p>6.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Forward Contract Payments</strong>&nbsp;- You must ensure that you pay into our account the full amount required to settle all Forward Contracts on or before the Maturity Date. If we have not received the funds by the Maturity Date (or any agreed change to the maturity date), we reserve the right to Close Out the Transaction in accordance with paragraph 9.</p>\n\n<p>6.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>No Cash or Cheques</strong>&nbsp;- You acknowledge that we do not accept cash or cheques. You agree to make all payments to our account electronically and you acknowledge that we will transmit your funds by electronic means only.</p>\n\n<p>6.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Beneficiary Account</strong>&nbsp;- You must provide us with full details of your Beneficiary Account, including the full name and address of the account holder and the full name and address of the beneficiary bank, on or before the date that we nominate.&nbsp;If you fail to do so, we reserve the right to Close Out the Transaction in accordance with paragraph 9.</p>\n\n<p>6.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Beneficiary Account Number<em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;</em></strong>We will rely solely on the account number you give us for your Beneficiary Account and will not check to ensure that the name provided by you accords with the account number you have given us.</p>\n\n<p>6.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Full Amount</strong>&nbsp;- All payments must be received by us in cleared funds and for the full amount being transferred, including any transaction fees that may be payable and any service fees that have been requested by us or any third party, before we will credit your Beneficiary Account. In the event that we agree to make a payment for you without having received the full amount, you acknowledge that we are not waiving our right to ask you for the full amount after the Transaction has been processed.</p>\n\n<p>6.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Funds Held by Us&nbsp;</strong><em>-&nbsp;</em>You acknowledge and agree that we do not hold your funds on trust and will not put your funds into a separate bank account.</p>\n\n<p>6.8<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No Interest Paid</strong>&nbsp;- You acknowledge that we will not pay to you any interest on any funds held by us whether by way of Advance Payment or otherwise.</p>\n\n<p><strong>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Misdirected Funds</strong></p>\n\n<p>7.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Your Mistake</strong>&nbsp;- If your funds are sent to the wrong account as the result of a mistake made by you, and we have acted in accordance with your Instructions, we will be under no obligation either to recover the funds or to resend the funds to the correct Beneficiary Account. You will need to book a new Transaction.</p>\n\n<p>7.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Our Mistake</strong>&nbsp;- If your funds are sent to the wrong account as the result of a mistake made by us, we will take urgent action at our own expense to recover those funds, provided that you take immediate action to assist us to recover any such funds if the mistaken beneficiary is related to you or associated with you in some way.</p>\n\n<p><strong>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Orders</strong></p>\n\n<p>8.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Legally Binding<em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;</em></strong>You may&nbsp;enter into an Order online, by telephone or by email. Subject to your right to cancel the Order in accordance with clause 8.2, the Order will become binding as and from the time that your Instructions are received by us. After we receive your Instructions, we will send you an Order Confirmation. The Order Confirmation constitutes an error correction mechanism only; if you do not contact us immediately on receipt of the Order Confirmation, the Transaction details will be deemed to be correct.</p>\n\n<p>8.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Cancellation of Orders by Telephone Only</strong>&nbsp;- You may cancel an Order at any time before the Target Rate is reached by giving us notice by telephone. You may not cancel an Order after the Target Rate has been reached, whether or not we have notified you that the Target Rate has been reached. When the Target Rate is reached, you are legally bound by the Transaction.</p>\n\n<p>8.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Target Rate</strong>&nbsp;- The Target Rate will be deemed to have been reached only when the exchange rate nominated in your Order has been filled with our provider. This will occur when the rate you have nominated has been exceeded by an amount that includes our Margin. You may find that, in some cases, the exchange rate spikes with the result that the exchange rate you have nominated in your Order has been reached but has changed before we are able to fill the Order with our provider; for the avoidance of doubt, we will not fill your Order in those circumstances.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>8.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Payment<em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;</em></strong>We will endeavour to notify you by telephone or email as soon as possible on the Business Day or on the next Business Day after the Target Rate has been reached. As soon as you receive our notification, you must take action to ensure that the funds reach our account by the Delivery Date. If we do not receive the funds in time, we reserve our right to Close Out the Transaction in accordance with paragraph 9.</p>\n\n<p><strong>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Closing Out</strong></p>\n\n<p>9.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Closing Out Transactions&nbsp;</strong>We may refuse to perform a Transaction, or we may Close Out a particular Transaction or all current Transactions that you have with us, without notice to you:</p>\n\n<p>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if you fail to make any payment when it is due, including the payment of any Advance Payment that has been requested by us;<br>\n(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if you fail to provide any material information we have requested or any information you have given us is or becomes, in our opinion, materially inaccurate or misleading;<br>\n(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the event of your death or loss of mental capacity;<br>\n(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the event that bankruptcy proceedings are commenced against you;<br>\n(v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if the performance of our obligations under this Agreement become illegal;<br>\n(vi)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if a serious dispute has arisen between us; or<br>\n(vii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if you breach an important term of this Agreement or of any Transaction.</p>\n\n<p>9.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Consequences of</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Closing Out&nbsp;</strong>- When we Close Out any or all of the &nbsp;Transactions that you have entered into, we buy back the currency that we have bought for you when you entered into the Transaction at prevailing market rates chosen by us in good faith. If the value of the currency you have asked us to exchange has strengthened, a loss will be incurred on the Transaction and you will be liable to pay us the amount of that loss, together with any expenses, premiums, commissions or other fees incurred by us.</p>\n\n<p>9.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>No Payment of Profit&nbsp;</strong>- We will not pay you any profit arising from Closing Out a Transaction in any circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>9.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Payment of Loss</strong>&nbsp;- You acknowledge that the amount of any loss realised on the Closing Out of a Transaction is a debt payable by you and agree that we may immediately deduct the total amount of any loss (together with any expenses, premiums, commissions or other fees) from any funds we hold in relation to any Transaction whether in the form of an Advance Payment or otherwise. If the amount we are seeking to recover exceeds the amount of any Advance Payment or other funds held by us, you agree to pay the balance within 7 days of being notified by us of the total amount due.</p>\n\n<p>9.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Interest&nbsp;</strong>- You agree that we may charge you interest on any sum that remains payable to us after we Close Out any or all of your Transactions at a rate of 2% per annum over the cash rate target of the Reserve Bank of Australia (or of such monetary authority as may replace it). Interest will accrue and will be calculated daily and be compounded monthly from the date payment was due until the date full payment is made by you.</p>\n\n<p>9.6<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Default Notification&nbsp;</strong>- You must&nbsp;notify us immediately if you become aware of any event referred to in Clause 9.1 above.</p>\n\n<p>9.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Notice of Monies Due&nbsp;</strong>- If we Close Out a Transaction, we will send you a written statement explaining the amount of any sums that may be payable to us and the amount of any sums being withheld by us.</p>\n\n<p><strong>10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing (\"AML/CTF\")</strong></p>\n\n<p>10.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>AML/CTF Compliance -&nbsp;</strong>You undertake that you will not knowingly do anything&nbsp;to put us in breach of the&nbsp;<em>Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act</em>&nbsp;2006, rules and other subordinate instruments (AML/CTF Laws).

You acknowledge that we may agree to such a request entirely at our discretion.

The Option Agreement will become legally binding as and from the time that the Option Transaction details are orally agreed between us in the telephone call. After the telephone call, we will send you an Option Agreement Confirmation. The Option Agreement Confirmation constitutes an error correction mechanism only; if you do not contact us within 24 hours of receipt of the Option Agreement Confirmation, the details of the Option Agreement will be deemed to be correct. If you do not receive the Option Agreement Confirmation, the Transaction is still legally binding and will be evidenced by the transcript of the telephone conversation in which it was booked.</p>\n\n<p>7.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Payment of Premium</strong>&nbsp;- The Premium agreed to in the Option Agreement must be paid within 2 Business Days&nbsp;of the Option being entered into in accordance with clause 7.1.</p>\n\n<p>7.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Non Payment of Premium</strong>&nbsp;- In the event that you fail to pay the Premium in accordance with clause 7.2, we reserve the right to terminate the Option Agreement upon 24 hours oral or written notice.

It does not relate to the underlying foreign exchange transaction that will be entered into if the Option is Exercised and will not be applied in reduction of the settlement sum payable under any such foreign exchange transaction.</p>\n\n<p>7.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Exercise of Option</strong>&nbsp;- Should you decide to exercise the Option, you must notify us of your election to do so either orally by telephone or in writing by email not later than midday (12.00pm) on the Expiry Date.</p>\n\n<p>7.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Consequences of Exercising the Option</strong>&nbsp;- You acknowledge that, upon exercise of the Option, you will automatically have entered into the Spot Contract detailed in the Option Agreement Confirmation and will be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement that apply to such Spot Contract.

You may not cancel an Order after the Target Rate has been reached, whether or not we have notified you that the Target Rate has been reached. When the Target Rate is reached, you are legally bound by the Transaction.</p>\n\n<p>8.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Target Rate</strong>&nbsp;- The Target Rate will be deemed to have been reached only when the exchange rate nominated in your Order has been filled with our provider. This will occur when the rate you have nominated has been exceeded by an amount that includes our Margin. You may find that, in some cases, the exchange rate spikes with the result that the exchange rate you have nominated in your Order has been reached but has changed before we are able to fill the Order with our provider; for the avoidance of doubt, we will not fill your Order in those circumstances.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>8.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Payment<em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;</em></strong>We will endeavour to notify you by telephone or email as soon as possible on the Business Day or on the next Business Day after the Target Rate has been reached.
