(“the Bank”).  All Online Banking Services of any kind whatsoever offered or afforded by the Bank (including, but not limited to funds transfers, bill payment services, wire transfers, and ACH transactions) will be referred to collectively as “Online Banking Services” in the Agreement.  The term “Business Day” means all days except Saturday, Sunday and all banking holidays.  All Banking Services are governed by this Agreement, and all applicable federal regulatory disclosures and the Deposit Account Terms and Conditions.  All applicable fee schedules published by the Bank from time to time will apply to the Online Banking Services.  You agree to pay all such fees upon request of the Bank.  Further, you agree to pay all telephone charges of fees incurred by you in accessing Online Banking Services.  Your initial use of any Online Banking Services in connection with your account at the Bank constitutes your acceptance and agreement to be bound by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement and of the Deposit Account Terms and Conditions.  Such initial use acknowledges your receipt and understanding of the Agreement and Deposit Account Terms and Conditions.  You agree that the Bank may, as permitted by law, provide all applicable disclosures to you electronically.  You are responsible for downloading or printing the disclosures or providing the Bank with a non-electronic address to which the disclosures may be mailed.  The Bank is entitled to act upon instructions received through any Online Banking Service under your Access ID and Password (going forward, together referred to as “Access Code”) and without inquiring into the identity of the person using that Access Code.  However, you agree that you will not, under any circumstances, disclose your Access Code by telephone or any other means to any person.  You acknowledge that no person from the Bank will ever ask for your Access Code, that Bank employees do not need or should not ask for your Access Code.  You agree to never provide your Access Code to anyone, including anyone claiming to represent the Bank.  You are liable for all transactions made or authorized using your Access Code.  The Bank has no responsibility for establishing the identity of any person or determining the validity of any transaction.  You agree that if you give your Access Code to anyone or fail to safeguard its secrecy, you do so at your own risk since anyone with your Access Code will have access to your accounts.  You agree to notify the Bank immediately in the event your Access Code is lost or stolen, or is otherwise compromised.  At any time, you may ask the Bank to disable your Access Code.  For joint accounts, each person may have a separate Access Code.  Each person on a joint account will be liable for all transactions that are made on that account.  Each person on a joint account agrees to be liable for the actions of the other person(s) on the account.You hereby indemnify and release the Bank from any and all liability and agree not to make any claim against the Bank or bring any action against the Bank honoring or allowing any actions or transactions where you have authorized the person performing the action or transaction to use your account or when you have provided your Access Code to that person.  You agree to reimburse the Bank for any losses it suffers or any damages, injuries, costs or expenses it incurs (including attorney’s fees) as a result of the Bank’s honoring or allowing transactions on the account where the Access Code was used.  The limitations of liability set forth in this Agreement are subject to, and limited by any state or federal law to the contrary.  The Bank has the right to modify or terminate this Agreement or the Deposit Account Terms and Conditions at any time.  When making changes, the Bank will comply with all legal notice requirements.  Once this agreement is terminated, The Bank will not allow additional transactions on the account, nor will additional Online Banking Services be permitted.  If this Agreement is modified, your continued use of the account will represent your acceptance of the changes. Your Responsibility:A.  Physical and Electronic Security.I.

To ensure that these services are provided in a secure and private manner, First Mid uses a full range of Internet security measures designed to protect our customers and First Mid.  These security measures include the use of cryptography; secure browsers and server, routers and firewalls; SSL protocol, digital certificates, multifactor authentication using PassMark, passwords and PINS, and cookies.  Each of these components acts as a layer of protection to safeguard sensitive data from unauthorized access as it travels over the Internet.Cryptography:  All customer information is encrypted and authenticated using 128 bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to provide the highest level of security commercially available to encrypt online transactions.  SSL allows for information to be sent and received securely over the Internet.  When a SSL connection occurs, security features within the browser and the server create a secure connection, in which all information shared is encrypted and de-crypted by only the intended recipients, ensuring that all data and transactions are secure as they are communicated over the Internet.Firewalls:  Firewalls are a combination of hardware and software that measure and limit access to a server or network for security purposes.  The firewall is a system between the Internet and a network to provide security from the Internet to the internal network.  The firewall keeps track of transaction activity, the time of each transaction, and who performed it.  For added security:  We have installed “time out” features.  Should you leave Online Banking without first signing off, you will be automatically logged off after a specific period of time.  We will not log you out if you have accessed a link with another site that maintains security with our banking site.For your protection:  We strongly recommend that you log out and close your browser session after each visit to Online Banking. Cookies:  Each browser accessing First Mid’s Online Banking is given a “cookie.”  A cookie is a piece of information sent by a web server to a web browser.  The web browser saves and sends the cookie back to the server each time the browser accesses the site.  Cookies allow a web site to identify whether or not a user previously visited the site.Passwords and PINS:  Passwords are utilized to gain access to Online Banking along with an image identification and password phrases provided by PassMark in association with our Online Banking service provider.  You will be required to change your password every 90 days, however, you can change your password as often as you wish.  Passwords are case sensitive and after three unsuccessful password attempts, the system locks your account.   You can obtain a new password by clicking on the “forgotten password” link and enter in your User Code to receive a temporary password via email.  You will be prompted to change this password to a password of your choice.  Your new password must be between 8-17 characters and contain 1 number, 1 uppercase letter and 1 lower case letter. You are responsible for the confidentiality of your password.  You should keep all passwords confidential to prevent unauthorized access to your accounts.  When you have successfully entered you password, First Mid is entitled to allow you to review your accounts through Online Banking.  This means that whoever has possession of your password will have access to your account information and could potentially initiate transactions.  If you believe that your password has been lost, stolen or compromised, you should contact us immediately.First Mid reserves the right to change this policy at any time by posting a new Security Statement to alert you to those changes.Terms and Conditions of the Bill Payment ServiceSERVICE DEFINITIONS\"Service\" means the bill payment service offered by First Mid-Illinois Bank & Trust through CheckFree Services Corporation. \"Agreement\" means these terms and conditions of the bill payment service. \"Biller\" is the person or entity to which you wish a bill payment to be directed or is the person or entity from which you receive electronic bills, as the case may be. \"Payment Instruction\" is the information provided by you to the Service for a bill payment to be made to the Biller (such as, but not limited to, Biller name, Biller account number, and Scheduled Payment Date). \"Payment Account\" is the checking account from which bill payments will be debited. \"Billing Account\" is the checking account from which all Service fees will be automatically debited. \"Business Day\" is every Monday through Friday, excluding Federal Reserve holidays. \"Scheduled Payment Date\" is the day you want your Biller to receive your bill payment and is also the day your Payment Account will be debited, unless the Scheduled Payment Date falls on a non-Business Day in which case it will be considered to be the previous Business Day. \"Due Date\" is the date reflected on your Biller statement for which the payment is due; it is not the late date or grace period. \"Scheduled Payment\" is a payment that has been scheduled through the Service but has not begun processing. PAYMENT SCHEDULINGThe earliest possible Scheduled Payment Date for each Biller (typically four (4) or fewer Business Days from the current date) will be designated within the application when you are scheduling the payment. Therefore, the application will not permit you to select a Scheduled Payment Date less than the earliest possible Scheduled Payment Date designated for each Biller. When scheduling payments you must select a Scheduled Payment Date that is no later than the actual Due Date reflected on your Biller statement unless the Due Date falls on a non-Business Day. If the actual Due Date falls on a non-Business Day, you must select a Scheduled Payment Date that is at least one (1) Business Day before the actual Due Date. Scheduled Payment Dates must be prior to any late date or grace period. THE SERVICE GUARANTEEDue to circumstances beyond the control of the Service, particularly delays in handling and posting payments by Billers or financial institutions, some transactions may take longer to be credited to your account. The Service will bear responsibility for any late payment related charges up to $50.00 should a payment post after its Due Date as long as the payment was scheduled in accordance with the guidelines described under \"Payment Scheduling\" in this Agreement. PAYMENT AUTHORIZATION AND PAYMENT REMITTANCEYou represent and warrant that you are acting with full authority for the applying entity, and that you are duly authorized to execute this Agreement on behalf of the applying entity. By providing the Service with names and account information of Billers to whom you wish to direct payments, you authorize the Service to follow the Payment Instructions that it receives through the payment system. In order to process payments more efficiently and effectively, the Service may edit or alter payment data or data formats in accordance with Biller directives. When the Service receives a Payment Instruction, you authorize the Service to debit your Payment Account and remit funds on your behalf so that the funds arrive as close as reasonably possible to the Scheduled Payment Date designated by you. You also authorize the Service to credit your Payment Account for payments returned to the Service by the United States Postal Service or Biller, or payments remitted to you on behalf of another authorized user of the Service. The Service will use its best efforts to make all your payments properly. However, the Service shall incur no liability and any Service Guarantee shall be void if the Service is unable to complete any payments initiated by you because of the existence of any one or more of the following circumstances: 1. If, through no fault of the Service, your Payment Account does not contain sufficient funds to complete the transaction or the transaction would exceed the credit limit of your overdraft account; 2. The payment processing center is not working properly and you know or have been advised by the Service about the malfunction before you execute the transaction; 3. You have not provided the Service with the correct Payment Account information, or the correct name, address, phone number, or account information for the Biller; and/or, 4. Circumstances beyond control of the Service (such as, but not limited to, fire, flood, or interference from an outside force) prevent the proper execution of the transaction and the Service has taken reasonable precautions to avoid those circumstances. Provided none of the foregoing exceptions are applicable, if the Service causes an incorrect amount of funds to be removed from your Payment Account or causes funds from your Payment Account to be directed to a Biller which does not comply with your Payment Instructions, the Service shall be responsible for returning the improperly transferred funds to your Payment Account, and for directing to the proper Biller any previously misdirected transactions, and, if applicable, for any late payment related charges. PAYMENT METHODSThe Service reserves the right to select the method in which to remit funds on your behalf to your Biller. These payment methods may include, but may not be limited to, an electronic payment, an electronic to check payment, or a laser draft payment (funds remitted to the Biller are deducted from your Payment Account when the laser draft is presented to your financial institution for payment). PAYMENT CANCELLATION REQUESTSYou may cancel or edit any Scheduled Payment (including recurring payments) by following the directions within the application. There is no charge for canceling or editing a Scheduled Payment. Once the Service has begun processing a payment it cannot be cancelled or edited, therefore a stop payment request must be submitted. STOP PAYMENT REQUESTSThe Service&#39;s ability to process a stop payment request will depend on the payment method and whether or not a check has cleared. The Service may also not have a reasonable opportunity to act on any stop payment request after a payment has been processed. If you desire to stop any payment that has already been processed, you must contact Customer Service. Although the Service will make every effort to accommodate your request, the Service will have no liability for failing to do so. The Service may also require you to present your request in writing within fourteen (14) days. The charge for each stop payment request will be the current charge for such service as set out in the applicable fee schedule. PROHIBITED PAYMENTSPayments to Billers outside of the United States or its territories are prohibited through the Service. EXCEPTION PAYMENTSTax payments and court ordered payments may be scheduled through the Service, however such payments are discouraged and must be scheduled at your own risk. In no event shall the Service be liable for any claims or damages resulting from your scheduling of these types of payments. The Service Guarantee as it applies to any late payment related changes is void when these types of payments are scheduled and/or processed by the Service. The Service has no obligation to research or resolve any claim resulting from an exception payment. All research and resolution for any misapplied, mis-posted or misdirected payments will be the sole responsibility of you and not of the Service. BILL DELIVERY AND PRESENTMENTThis feature is for the presentment of electronic bills only and it is your sole responsibility to contact your Billers directly if you do not receive your statements.

If your monthly financial institution statement contains transfers that you did not authorize, you must tell us at once. If you do not tell us within sixty (60) days after the statement was sent to you, you may lose any amount transferred without your authorization after the sixty (60) days if we can prove that we could have stopped someone from taking the money had you told us in time.
