He was also an important and influential composer, a notable piano teacher, a conductor who contributed significantly to the modern development of the art, and a benefactor to other composers and performers, notably Richard Wagner and Hector Berlioz.<br>\n<br>\nAs a composer, Liszt was one of the most prominent representatives of the \"Neudeutsche Schule\" (\"New German School\"). He left behind a huge and diverse oeuvre, in which he influenced his forward-looking contemporaries and anticipated some 20th-century ideas and trends. Some of his most notable contributions were the invention of the symphonic poem, developing the concept of thematic transformation as part of his experiments in musical form and making radical departures in harmony.<br>\n<br>\nLiszt has most frequently been credited to have been the first pianist who gave concerts with programs consisting only of solo pieces. An example is a concert he gave on March 9, 1839, at the Palazzo Poli in Rome. Since Liszt could not find singers who — following the usual habit of the time — should have completed the program, he played four numbers all alone.<br>\n<br>\nLiszt was a prolific composer. Most of his music is for the piano and much of it requires formidable technique.In his most famous and virtuosic works, he is the archetypal Romantic composer. Liszt pioneered the technique of thematic transformation, a method of development which was related to both the existing variation technique and to the new use of the Leitmotif by Richard Wagner. Liszt's piano works are usually divided into two classes. On the one hand, there are \"original works\", and on the other hand \"transcriptions\", \"paraphrases\" or \"fantasies\" on works by other composers.<br>\n<br>\n</span>\n                        <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n                                                    <div class=\"sheetItem\">\n                                <div class=\"sheetinfo\">\n                                    <div class=\"sheetinfotop\">\n                                        <a href=\"/piano/sheets/45127/Liszt_Dreams_of_Love.html\">Dreams of Love Sheet Music</a>\n                                    </div>\n                                    <div class=\"sheetinfobottom\">\n                                        &nbsp;\n                                    </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n                            </div>\n                                            </div>\n                    <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n               </div>\n                            <div style=\"width:98%; padding:10px; margin:0px; border-bottom: 1px solid maroon;\">\n                    <div style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight:bold; margin:15px 0px;\">Ernesto Lecuona</div>\n                    <div class=\"artistinfo\" style=\"float:left; width:25%;\">\n                                                    <img src=\"/artistimgs/201604/01/2487_Ernesto_Lecuona.jpg\" alt=\"Ernesto Lecuona\" align=\"left\" style=\"margin:0px 10px 10px 10px;\">\n                                            </div>\n                    <div style=\"float:left; width:70%;\">\n                        <span style=\"font-size:14px;\">Ernesto Lecuona y Casado (Spanish pronunciation: ; August 6, 1895 – November 29, 1963) was a Cuban composer and pianist of worldwide fame.

Lloyd Webber started composing at the age of six, and published his first piece at the age of nine.<br>\nLloyd Webber has achieved great popular success, with several musicals that have run for more than a decade both in the West End and on Broadway. He has composed 13 musicals, a song cycle, a set of variations, two film scores, and a Latin Requiem Mass. He has also gained a number of honours, including a knighthood in 1992, followed by a peerage from the British Government for services to Music, seven Tony Awards (and 40 nominations), three Grammy Awards (with an additional 60 nominations), an Academy Award (two other nominations), seven Olivier Awards (with 100 nominations), a Golden Globe, and the Kennedy Center Honors in 2006. Several of his songs, notably \"The Music of the Night\" from The Phantom of the Opera, \"I Don't Know How to Love Him\" from Jesus Christ Superstar, \"Don't Cry for Me, Argentina\" from Evita, \"Any Dream Will Do\" from Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat and \"Memory\" from Cats have been widely recorded and were hits outside of their parent musicals. His company, the Really Useful Group, is one of the largest theatre operators in London.<br>\nProducers in several parts of the UK have staged productions, including national tours, of Lloyd Webber's musicals under licence from the Really Useful Group. According to britishhitsongwriters.com, he is the one hundredth most successful songwriter in U.K. singles chart history, based on weeks that his compositions have spent on the chart.</span>\n                        <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n                                                    <div class=\"sheetItem\">\n                                <div class=\"sheetinfo\">\n                                    <div class=\"sheetinfotop\">\n                                        <a href=\"/piano/sheets/45145/Andrew_Lloyd_Webber_As_If_We_Never_Said_Goodbye.html\">As If We Never Said Goodbye Sheet Music</a>\n                                    </div>\n                                    <div class=\"sheetinfobottom\">\n                                        &nbsp;\n                                    </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n                            </div>\n                                            </div>\n                    <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n               </div>\n                            <div style=\"width:98%; padding:10px; margin:0px; border-bottom: 1px solid maroon;\">\n                    <div style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight:bold; margin:15px 0px;\">Sammy Nestico</div>\n                    <div class=\"artistinfo\" style=\"float:left; width:25%;\">\n                                                    <img src=\"/artistimgs/201105/25/2156_Sammy_Nestico.jpg\" alt=\"Sammy Nestico\" align=\"left\" style=\"margin:0px 10px 10px 10px;\">\n                                            </div>\n                    <div style=\"float:left; width:70%;\">\n                        <span style=\"font-size:14px;\">Samuel \"Sammy\" Louis Nestico (born February 6, 1924 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) is a prolific and well known composer and arranger of big band music.

His over 600 compositions include works widely acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic, concertante, chamber, piano, operatic, and choral music. Mozart is among the most enduringly popular of classical composers, and many of his works are part of the standard concert repertoire.<br>\n<br>\nMozart's music, like Haydn's, stands as an archetypal example of the Classical style. His works spanned the period during which that style transformed from one exemplified by the style galant to one that began to incorporate some of the contrapuntal complexities of the late Baroque, complexities against which the galant style had been a reaction. Mozart's own stylistic development closely paralleled the development of the classical style as a whole. In addition, he was a versatile composer and wrote in almost every major genre, including symphony, opera, the solo concerto, chamber music including string quartet and string quintet, and the piano sonata. While none of these genres were new, the piano concerto was almost single-handedly developed and popularized by Mozart. He also wrote a great deal of religious music, including masses; and he composed many dances, divertimenti, serenades, and other forms of light entertainment.<br>\n<br>\nThe central traits of the classical style can be identified in Mozart's music. Clarity, balance, and transparency are hallmarks of his work.</span>\n                        <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n                                                    <div class=\"sheetItem\">\n                                <div class=\"sheetinfo\">\n                                    <div class=\"sheetinfotop\">\n                                        <a href=\"/piano/sheets/45123/Mozart_Piano_Sonata_2.html\">Piano Sonata 2 Sheet Music</a>\n                                    </div>\n                                    <div class=\"sheetinfobottom\">\n                                        &nbsp;\n                                    </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n                            </div>\n                                            </div>\n                    <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n               </div>\n                            <div style=\"width:98%; padding:10px; margin:0px; border-bottom: 1px solid maroon;\">\n                    <div style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight:bold; margin:15px 0px;\">Jeff Blumenkrantz</div>\n                    <div class=\"artistinfo\" style=\"float:left; width:25%;\">\n                                                    <img src=\"/artistimgs/201608/26/2588_Jeff_Blumenkrantz.jpg\" alt=\"Jeff Blumenkrantz\" align=\"left\" style=\"margin:0px 10px 10px 10px;\">\n                                            </div>\n                    <div style=\"float:left; width:70%;\">\n                        <span style=\"font-size:14px;\">Jeff Blumenkrantz is an actor, composer and lyricist.

Unlike most other great opera composers, Wagner wrote both the scenario and libretto for his works.<br>\n<br>\nWagner's compositions, particularly those of his later period, are notable for contrapuntal texture, rich chromaticism, harmonies and orchestration, and elaborate use of leitmotifs: musical themes associated with particular characters, locales or plot elements. Wagner pioneered advances in musical language, such as extreme chromaticism and quickly shifting tonal centres, which greatly influenced the development of European classical music.<br>\n<br>\nHe transformed musical thought through his idea of Gesamtkunstwerk (\"total artwork\"), the synthesis of all the poetic, visual, musical and dramatic arts, epitomized by his monumental four-opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen (1876). To try to stage these works as he imagined them, Wagner built his own opera house.<br>\n<br>\nWagner's musical style is often considered the epitome of classical music's Romantic period, due to its unprecedented exploration of emotional expression. He introduced new ideas in harmony and musical form, including extreme chromaticism. In Tristan und Isolde, he explored the limits of the traditional tonal system that gave keys and chords their identity, pointing the way to atonality in the 20th century. Some music historians date the beginning of modern classical music to the first notes of Tristan, the so-called Tristan chord.</span>\n                        <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n                                                    <div class=\"sheetItem\">\n                                <div class=\"sheetinfo\">\n                                    <div class=\"sheetinfotop\">\n                                        <a href=\"/piano/sheets/45135/Wagner_Das_Reihngold__Walhall.html\">Das Reihngold - Walhall Sheet Music</a>\n                                    </div>\n                                    <div class=\"sheetinfobottom\">\n                                        &nbsp;\n                                    </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n                            </div>\n                                            </div>\n                    <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n               </div>\n                            <div style=\"width:98%; padding:10px; margin:0px; border-bottom: 1px solid maroon;\">\n                    <div style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight:bold; margin:15px 0px;\">James Horner</div>\n                    <div class=\"artistinfo\" style=\"float:left; width:25%;\">\n                                                    <img src=\"/artistimgs/201012/26/1984_James_Horner.jpg\" alt=\"James Horner\" align=\"left\" style=\"margin:0px 10px 10px 10px;\">\n                                            </div>\n                    <div style=\"float:left; width:70%;\">\n                        <span style=\"font-size:14px;\">James Roy Horner (born August 14, 1953) is an award winning American composer, orchestrator and conductor of orchestral and film music.

He is widely regarded as the greatest Polish composer, and ranks as one of music's greatest tone poets.<br>\n<br>\nHe was born in the village of Żelazowa Wola, in the Duchy of Warsaw, to a Polish mother and French-expatriate father, and in his early life was regarded as a child-prodigy pianist. In November 1830, at the age of 20, Chopin went abroad; following the suppression of the Polish November Uprising of 1830–31, he became one of many expatriates of the Polish \"Great Emigration.\"<br>\n<br>\nIn Paris, he made a comfortable living as a composer and piano teacher, while giving few public performances. A Polish patriot,<br>\n<br>\nChopin's extant compositions were written primarily for the piano as a solo instrument. Though technically demanding, Chopin's style emphasizes nuance and expressive depth rather than virtuosity. Chopin invented musical forms such as the ballade and was responsible for major innovations in forms such as the piano sonata, waltz, nocturne, étude, impromptu and prelude. His works are mainstays of Romanticism in 19th-century classical music.<br>\n</span>\n                        <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n                                                    <div class=\"sheetItem\">\n                                <div class=\"sheetinfo\">\n                                    <div class=\"sheetinfotop\">\n                                        <a href=\"/piano/sheets/45155/Chopin_Ballade.html\">Ballade Sheet Music</a>\n                                    </div>\n                                    <div class=\"sheetinfobottom\">\n                                        &nbsp;\n                                    </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n                            </div>\n                                                    <div class=\"sheetItem\">\n                                <div class=\"sheetinfo\">\n                                    <div class=\"sheetinfotop\">\n                                        <a href=\"/piano/sheets/45011/Chopin_Valse_DAdieu.html\">Valse D'Adieu Sheet Music</a>\n                                    </div>\n                                    <div class=\"sheetinfobottom\">\n                                        &nbsp;\n                                    </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n                            </div>\n                                            </div>\n                    <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n               </div>\n                            <div style=\"width:98%; padding:10px; margin:0px; border-bottom: 1px solid maroon;\">\n                    <div style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight:bold; margin:15px 0px;\">Keith Jarrett</div>\n                    <div class=\"artistinfo\" style=\"float:left; width:25%;\">\n                                                    <img src=\"/artistimgs/201011/25/49_Keith_Jarrett.jpg\" alt=\"Keith Jarrett\" align=\"left\" style=\"margin:0px 10px 10px 10px;\">\n                                            </div>\n                    <div style=\"float:left; width:70%;\">\n                        <span style=\"font-size:14px;\">Keith Jarrett (born May 8, 1945 in Allentown, Pennsylvania) is an American pianist and composer.<br>\n<br>\nHis career started with Art Blakey, Charles Lloyd and Miles Davis.

His mastery of the orchestra has been described as \"prodigious.\"<br>\nThe core of Sibelius's oeuvre is his set of seven symphonies. Like Beethoven, Sibelius used each successive work to further develop his own personal compositional style. His works continue to be performed frequently in the concert hall and are often recorded.<br>\nIn addition to the symphonies, Sibelius's best-known compositions include Finlandia, the Karelia Suite, Valse triste, the Violin Concerto in D minor and The Swan of Tuonela (one of the four movements of the Lemminkäinen Suite). Other works include pieces inspired by the Finnish national epic, the Kalevala; over 100 songs for voice and piano; incidental music for 13 plays; the opera Jungfrun i tornet (The Maiden in the Tower); chamber music; piano music; Masonic ritual music; and 21 separate publications of choral music.</span>\n                        <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n                                                    <div class=\"sheetItem\">\n                                <div class=\"sheetinfo\">\n                                    <div class=\"sheetinfotop\">\n                                        <a href=\"/flute/sheets/45175/Jean_Sibelius_Finlandia.html\">Finlandia Sheet Music</a>\n                                    </div>\n                                    <div class=\"sheetinfobottom\">\n                                        &nbsp;\n                                    </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n                            </div>\n                                            </div>\n                    <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n               </div>\n                            <div style=\"width:98%; padding:10px; margin:0px; border-bottom: 1px solid maroon;\">\n                    <div style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight:bold; margin:15px 0px;\">Isaac Albeniz</div>\n                    <div class=\"artistinfo\" style=\"float:left; width:25%;\">\n                                                    <img src=\"/artistimgs/201107/15/2231_Isaac_Albeniz.jpg\" alt=\"Isaac Albeniz\" align=\"left\" style=\"margin:0px 10px 10px 10px;\">\n                                            </div>\n                    <div style=\"float:left; width:70%;\">\n                        <span style=\"font-size:14px;\">Isaac Albéniz i Pascual (Spanish pronunciation: ) (May 29, 1860 – May 18, 1909) was a Spanish pianist and composer best known for his piano works based on folk music.<br>\n<br>\nAlbéniz’ Suite Española Op.47 is comprised mainly of pieces written in 1886, and grouped together in 1887 in honor of the Queen of Spain. Like many of Albéniz' piano pieces, these works are miniature tone pictures of different geographical regions and musical idioms of Spain. The eight original titles are Granada, Cataluna, Sevilla, Cadiz, Asturias, Aragon, Castilla and Cuba but only the first three titles and Cuba appeared in the original collection. The other pieces were published in later collections, often with different titles. The publisher Hofmeister published all eight titles of Suite Espanola in 1911 after Albéniz’ death, appropriating other pieces for the other four titles so those pieces do not always accurately reflect the geographic designation of the titles, most obviously in the case of Asturias (Leyenda) whose Andalusian flamenco rhythms bear little resemblance to the music of the northern province Asturias. The opus number 47 assigned by Hofmeister has no relation to any chronological order in Albéniz’ oeuvre, in which opus numbers were randomly given by publishers or by Albéniz himself, with some pieces appearing in more than one collection.</span>\n                        <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n                                                    <div class=\"sheetItem\">\n                                <div class=\"sheetinfo\">\n                                    <div class=\"sheetinfotop\">\n                                        <a href=\"/piano/sheets/45159/Isaac_Albeniz_Azulejos.html\">Azulejos Sheet Music</a>\n                                    </div>\n                                    <div class=\"sheetinfobottom\">\n                                        &nbsp;\n                                    </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n                            </div>\n                                            </div>\n                    <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n               </div>\n                            <div style=\"width:98%; padding:10px; margin:0px; border-bottom: 1px solid maroon;\">\n                    <div style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight:bold; margin:15px 0px;\">Ary Barroso</div>\n                    <div class=\"artistinfo\" style=\"float:left; width:25%;\">\n                                                    <img src=\"/artistimgs/201103/29/2027_Ary_Barroso.jpg\" alt=\"Ary Barroso\" align=\"left\" style=\"margin:0px 10px 10px 10px;\">\n                                            </div>\n                    <div style=\"float:left; width:70%;\">\n                        <span style=\"font-size:14px;\">Ary Barroso (November 7, 1903 in Ubá, Minas Gerais — February 9, 1964 in Rio de Janeiro) was a Brazilian composer, pianist, soccer commentator, and talent-show host on radio and TV.

He later began working on English language films, particularly those directed by Anthony Minghella. He won an Oscar for his work on The English Patient (1996) and was also nominated for The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999) and Cold Mountain (2003).<br>\n<br>\nIn 2004, Yared's score to the movie Troy (which he had spent nearly a year working on) was rejected (less than a month before the film's opening) due to the poor reception by an audience at a test screening. The test audience were said to have found Yared's music too 'brassy and bold'. James Horner was then hired to create a replacement score in less than two weeks.<br>\n<br>\nYared expressed his dismay at the score's rejection in an open letter which was posted on his website. He said that the score which the test audience had heard was not yet finished or mixed properly, and that the studio had given him no opportunity to alter his score in light of the audience reaction.<br>\n<br>\nWarner Bros. studio still currently owns the rights to Yared's Troy score and an official recording is not currently available and may never be (although selections from the score were briefly posted on Yared's website and bootleg versions are available for download on the web). Recently, due to contract holes, a German music label has released a CD with Gabriel Yared's original score.</span>\n                        <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n                                                    <div class=\"sheetItem\">\n                                <div class=\"sheetinfo\">\n                                    <div class=\"sheetinfotop\">\n                                        <a href=\"/piano/sheets/45151/Gabriel_Yared_Betty_Blue.html\">Betty Blue Sheet Music</a>\n                                    </div>\n                                    <div class=\"sheetinfobottom\">\n                                        &nbsp;\n                                    </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n                            </div>\n                                            </div>\n                    <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n               </div>\n                            <div style=\"width:98%; padding:10px; margin:0px; border-bottom: 1px solid maroon;\">\n                    <div style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight:bold; margin:15px 0px;\">Stephen Sondheim</div>\n                    <div class=\"artistinfo\" style=\"float:left; width:25%;\">\n                                                    <img src=\"/artistimgs/201012/26/1986_Stephen_Sondheim.jpg\" alt=\"Stephen Sondheim\" align=\"left\" style=\"margin:0px 10px 10px 10px;\">\n                                            </div>\n                    <div style=\"float:left; width:70%;\">\n                        <span style=\"font-size:14px;\">Stephen Joshua Sondheim (born March 22, 1930) is an American composer and lyricist for stage and film.

Born as Georg Friedrich Handel in Halle, he spent most of his adult life in England, becoming a subject of the British crown on 22 January 1727. His most famous works are Messiah, an oratorio set to texts from the King James Bible; Water Music; and Music for the Royal Fireworks. Strongly influenced by the techniques of the great composers of the Italian Baroque and the English composer Henry Purcell, his music was known to many significant composers who came after him, including Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven.<br>\n<br>\nHandel's compositions include 42 operas; 29 oratorios; more than 120 cantatas, trios and duets; numerous arias; chamber music; a large number of ecumenical pieces; odes and serenatas; and sixteen organ concerti. His most famous work, the Messiah oratorio with its \"Hallelujah\" chorus, is among the most popular works in choral music and has become a centerpiece of the Christmas season. Also popular are the Opus 3 and 6 Concerti Grossi, as well as \"The Cuckoo and the Nightingale\", in which birds are heard calling during passages played in different keys representing the vocal ranges of two birds. Also notable are his sixteen keyboard suites, especially The Harmonious Blacksmith.<br>\n<br>\nHandel introduced various previously uncommon musical instruments in his works: the viola d'amore and violetta marina (Orlando), the lute (Ode for St. Cecilia's Day), three trombones (Saul), clarinets or small high cornets (Tamerlano), theorbo, French horn (Water Music), lyrichord, double bassoon, viola da gamba, bell chimes, positive organ, and harp (Giulio Cesare, Alexander's Feast).</span>\n                        <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n                                                    <div class=\"sheetItem\">\n                                <div class=\"sheetinfo\">\n                                    <div class=\"sheetinfotop\">\n                                        <a href=\"/piano/sheets/45125/Handel_Arioso.html\">Arioso Sheet Music</a>\n                                    </div>\n                                    <div class=\"sheetinfobottom\">\n                                        &nbsp;\n                                    </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n                            </div>\n                                            </div>\n                    <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n               </div>\n                            <div style=\"width:98%; padding:10px; margin:0px; border-bottom: 1px solid maroon;\">\n                    <div style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight:bold; margin:15px 0px;\">Sister Act</div>\n                    <div class=\"artistinfo\" style=\"float:left; width:25%;\">\n                                                    <img src=\"/artistimgs/201011/25/184_Sister_Act.jpg\" alt=\"Sister Act\" align=\"left\" style=\"margin:0px 10px 10px 10px;\">\n                                            </div>\n                    <div style=\"float:left; width:70%;\">\n                        <span style=\"font-size:14px;\">Sister Act is a 1992 American comedy film released by Touchstone Pictures.

While not part of the nationalistic music group known as \"The Five\", Tchaikovsky wrote music which, in the opinion of Harold Schonberg, was distinctly Russian: plangent, introspective, with modally-inflected melody and harmony.<br>\n<br>\nAesthetically, Tchaikovsky remained open to all aspects of Saint Petersburg musical life. He was impressed by Serov and Balakirev as well as the classical values upheld by the conservatory. Both the progressive and conservative camps in Russian music at the time attempted to win him over. Tchaikovsky charted his compositional course between these two factions, retaining his individuality as a composer as well as his Russian identity. In this he was influenced by the ideals of his teacher Nikolai Rubinstein and Nikolai's brother Anton.<br>\n<br>\nTchaikovsky's musical cosmopolitanism led him to be favored by many Russian music-lovers over the \"Russian\" harmonies and styles of Mussorgsky, Borodin and Rimsky-Korsakov.<br>\n<br>\nNonetheless he frequently adapted Russian traditional melodies and dance forms in his music, which enhanced his success in his home country. The success in St. Petersburg at the premiere of his Third Orchestral Suite may have been due in large part to his concluding the work with a polonaise. He also used a polonaise for the final movement of his Third Symphony.</span>\n                        <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n                                                    <div class=\"sheetItem\">\n                                <div class=\"sheetinfo\">\n                                    <div class=\"sheetinfotop\">\n                                        <a href=\"/flute/sheets/45053/Tchaikovsky_Dance_of_Merliton.html\">Dance of Merliton Sheet Music</a>\n                                    </div>\n                                    <div class=\"sheetinfobottom\">\n                                        &nbsp;\n                                    </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n                            </div>\n                                            </div>\n                    <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n               </div>\n                            <div style=\"width:98%; padding:10px; margin:0px; border-bottom: 1px solid maroon;\">\n                    <div style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight:bold; margin:15px 0px;\">James Scott</div>\n                    <div class=\"artistinfo\" style=\"float:left; width:25%;\">\n                                                    <img src=\"/artistimgs/201105/11/2123_James_Scott.jpg\" alt=\"James Scott\" align=\"left\" style=\"margin:0px 10px 10px 10px;\">\n                                            </div>\n                    <div style=\"float:left; width:70%;\">\n                        <span style=\"font-size:14px;\">James Sylvester Scott (February 12, 1885 – August 30, 1938) was an African-American ragtime composer, regarded as one of the three most important composers of classic ragtime, along with Scott Joplin and Joseph Lamb.<br>\n<br>\nHe was born in Neosho, Missouri to James Scott Sr. and Molly Thomas Scott, both former slaves. In 1901 his family moved to Carthage, Missouri, where he attended Lincoln High School. In 1902 he began working at the music store of Charles L. Dumars, first at menial labor, but before long demonstrating music at the piano, including his own pieces. Demand for his music convinced Dumars to print the first of Scott's published compositions, \"A Summer Breeze\", in 1903.<br>\n<br>\nIn 1906 he moved to St. Louis, Missouri, where Scott Joplin introduced him to publisher John Stillwell Stark. The first Scott rag that Stark published, 'Frog Legs Rag', became a hit, and Scott became a regular contributor to the Stark catalogue. In 1914 Scott moved to Kansas City, Missouri, where he married Nora Johnson, taught music, and accompanied silent movies.</span>\n                        <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n                                                    <div class=\"sheetItem\">\n                                <div class=\"sheetinfo\">\n                                    <div class=\"sheetinfotop\">\n                                        <a href=\"/piano/sheets/45111/James_Scott_Frog_Legs_Rag.html\">Frog Legs Rag Sheet Music</a>\n                                    </div>\n                                    <div class=\"sheetinfobottom\">\n                                        &nbsp;\n                                    </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n                            </div>\n                                            </div>\n                    <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n               </div>\n                            <div style=\"width:98%; padding:10px; margin:0px; border-bottom: 1px solid maroon;\">\n                    <div style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight:bold; margin:15px 0px;\">Debussy</div>\n                    <div class=\"artistinfo\" style=\"float:left; width:25%;\">\n                                                    <img src=\"/artistimgs/201011/25/24_Debussy.jpg\" alt=\"Debussy\" align=\"left\" style=\"margin:0px 10px 10px 10px;\">\n                                            </div>\n                    <div style=\"float:left; width:70%;\">\n                        <span style=\"font-size:14px;\">Achille-Claude Debussy (August 22, 1862 – March 25, 1918) was a French composer. Along with Maurice Ravel, he is considered one of the most prominent figures working within the field of Impressionist music, though he himself intensely disliked the term when applied to his compositions. Debussy was not only among the most important of all French composers but also was a central figure in all European music at the turn of the twentieth century.<br>\n<br>\nDebussy's music virtually defines the transition from late-Romantic music to twentieth century modernist music. In French literary circles, the style of this period was known as Symbolism, a movement that directly inspired Debussy both as a composer and as an active cultural participant.<br>\n</span>\n                        <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n                                                    <div class=\"sheetItem\">\n                                <div class=\"sheetinfo\">\n                                    <div class=\"sheetinfotop\">\n                                        <a href=\"/piano/sheets/45049/Debussy_La_mer_1.html\">La mer 1 Sheet Music</a>\n                                    </div>\n                                    <div class=\"sheetinfobottom\">\n                                        &nbsp;\n                                    </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n                            </div>\n                                                    <div class=\"sheetItem\">\n                                <div class=\"sheetinfo\">\n                                    <div class=\"sheetinfotop\">\n                                        <a href=\"/piano/sheets/45051/Debussy_La_mer_3.html\">La mer 3 Sheet Music</a>\n                                    </div>\n                                    <div class=\"sheetinfobottom\">\n                                        &nbsp;\n                                    </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n                            </div>\n                                            </div>\n                    <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n               </div>\n                            <div style=\"width:98%;

He was recognized early as a musical prodigy, but his parents were cautious and did not seek to capitalise on his abilities. Indeed his father was disinclined to allow Felix to follow a musical career until it became clear that he intended to seriously dedicate himself to it.<br>\n<br>\nEarly success in Germany was followed by travel throughout Europe; Mendelssohn was particularly well received in England as a composer, conductor and soloist, and his ten visits there, during which many of his major works were premiered, form an important part of his adult career. His essentially conservative musical tastes however set him apart from many of his more adventurous musical contemporaries such as Liszt, Wagner and Berlioz. The Conservatory he founded at Leipzig became a bastion of this anti-radical outlook.<br>\n<br>\nMendelssohn's work includes symphonies, concerti, oratorios, piano and chamber music. He also had an important role in the revival of interest in the music of Johann Sebastian Bach. After a long period of relative denigration due to changing musical tastes and antisemitism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, his creative originality is now being recognized and re-evaluated. He is now among the most popular composers of the Romantic era.<br>\n</span>\n                        <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n                                                    <div class=\"sheetItem\">\n                                <div class=\"sheetinfo\">\n                                    <div class=\"sheetinfotop\">\n                                        <a href=\"/piano/sheets/45071/Felix_Mendelssohn_Concert_Piece_No1_Op113_for_clarinet_in_sib_and_basset_clarinet.html\">Concert Piece No.1, Op.113 for clarinet in sib and basset clarinet Sheet Music</a>\n                                    </div>\n                                    <div class=\"sheetinfobottom\">\n                                        &nbsp;\n                                    </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n                            </div>\n                                            </div>\n                    <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n               </div>\n                            <div style=\"width:98%; padding:10px; margin:0px; border-bottom: 1px solid maroon;\">\n                    <div style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight:bold; margin:15px 0px;\">Zdenko Fibich</div>\n                    <div class=\"artistinfo\" style=\"float:left; width:25%;\">\n                                                    <img src=\"/artistimgs/201605/07/2559_Zdenko_Fibich.jpg\" alt=\"Zdenko Fibich\" align=\"left\" style=\"margin:0px 10px 10px 10px;\">\n                                            </div>\n                    <div style=\"float:left; width:70%;\">\n                        <span style=\"font-size:14px;\">Zdeněk Fibich (Czech pronunciation: , 21 December 1850 – 15 October 1900) was a Czech composer of classical music. Among his compositions are chamber works (including two string quartets, a piano trio, piano quartet and a quintet for piano, strings and winds), symphonic poems, three symphonies, at least seven operas (the most famous probably Šárka and The Bride of Messina), melodramas including the substantial trilogy Hippodamia, liturgical music including a mass – a missa brevis; and a large cycle (almost 400 pieces, from the 1890s) of piano works called Moods, Impressions, and Reminiscences. The piano cycle served as a diary of sorts of his love for a piano pupil.

Youmans' early songs are remarkable for their economy of melodic material: two-, three- or four-note phrases are constantly repeated and varied by subtle harmonic or rhythmic changes. In later years, however, apparently influenced by Jerome Kern, he turned to longer musical sentences and more free-flowing melodic lines. Youmans published fewer than 100 songs, but 18 of these were considered standards by ASCAP, a remarkably high percentage.</span>\n                        <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n                                                    <div class=\"sheetItem\">\n                                <div class=\"sheetinfo\">\n                                    <div class=\"sheetinfotop\">\n                                        <a href=\"/piano/sheets/45081/Vincent_Youmans_Tea_for_two_piano_duet.html\">Tea for two piano duet Sheet Music</a>\n                                    </div>\n                                    <div class=\"sheetinfobottom\">\n                                        &nbsp;\n                                    </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n                            </div>\n                                            </div>\n                    <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n               </div>\n                            <div style=\"width:98%; padding:10px; margin:0px; border-bottom: 1px solid maroon;\">\n                    <div style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight:bold; margin:15px 0px;\">Carrie The Musical</div>\n                    <div class=\"artistinfo\" style=\"float:left; width:25%;\">\n                                                    <img src=\"/artistimgs/201605/07/2572_Carrie_The_Musical.jpg\" alt=\"Carrie The Musical\" align=\"left\" style=\"margin:0px 10px 10px 10px;\">\n                                            </div>\n                    <div style=\"float:left; width:70%;\">\n                        <span style=\"font-size:14px;\">Carrie: The Musical is a musical with a book by Lawrence D.

Although Herbert enjoyed important careers as a cello soloist and conductor, he is best known for composing many successful operettas that premiered on Broadway from the 1890s to World War I. He was also prominent among the tin pan alley composers and was later a founder of the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP). A prolific composer, Herbert produced two operas, a cantata, 43 operettas, incidental music to 10 plays, 31 compositions for orchestra, nine band compositions, nine cello compositions, five violin compositions with piano or orchestra, 22 piano compositions and numerous songs, choral compositions and orchestrations of works by other composers, among other music.<br>\n<br>\nIn the early 1880s, Herbert began a career as a cellist in Vienna, Austria, and Stuttgart, Germany, during which he began to compose orchestral music. Herbert and his opera singer wife, Therese Förster, moved to the U.S. in 1886 when both were engaged by the Metropolitan Opera. In the U.S., Herbert continued his performing career, while also teaching at the National Conservatory of Music, conducting and composing. His most notable instrumental compositions were his Cello Concerto No. 2 in E minor, Op. 30 (1894), which entered the standard repertoire, and his Auditorium Festival March (1901). He led the Pittsburgh Symphony from 1898 to 1904 and then founded the Victor Herbert Orchestra, which he conducted throughout the rest of his life.<br>\n<br>\nHerbert began to compose operettas in 1894, producing several successes, including The Serenade (1897) and The Fortune Teller (1898). Even more successful were some of the operettas that he wrote after the turn of the 20th century: Babes in Toyland (1903), Mlle.

After World War I, with the change of popular musical tastes, Herbert began to compose musicals and contributed music to other composers' shows.

He was also the father-in-law of Richard Wagner. In 1865 he became abbot in the Roman Catholic Church.<br>\nLiszt became renowned throughout Europe during the 19th century for his great skill as a performer. He was said by his contemporaries to have been the most technically advanced pianist of his age and perhaps the greatest pianist of all time. He was also an important and influential composer, a notable piano teacher, a conductor who contributed significantly to the modern development of the art, and a benefactor to other composers and performers, notably Richard Wagner, Hector Berlioz, Camille Saint-Saëns, Edvard Grieg and Alexander Borodin.<br>\nAs a composer, Liszt was one of the most prominent representatives of the \"Neudeutsche Schule\" (\"New German School\"). He left behind a huge and diverse body of work, in which he influenced his forward-looking contemporaries and anticipated some 20th-century ideas and trends. Some of his most notable contributions were the invention of the symphonic poem, developing the concept of thematic transformation as part of his experiments in musical form and making radical departures in harmony.<br>\n</span>\n                        <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n                                                    <div class=\"sheetItem\">\n                                <div class=\"sheetinfo\">\n                                    <div class=\"sheetinfotop\">\n                                        <a href=\"/piano/sheets/45073/Franz_Liszt_Transcendental_Etudes_after_Paganini.html\">Transcendental Etudes after Paganini Sheet Music</a>\n                                    </div>\n                                    <div class=\"sheetinfobottom\">\n                                        &nbsp;\n                                    </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n                            </div>\n                                            </div>\n                    <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n               </div>\n                            <div style=\"width:98%; padding:10px; margin:0px; border-bottom: 1px solid maroon;\">\n                    <div style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight:bold; margin:15px 0px;\">Richard Wermeling</div>\n                    <div class=\"artistinfo\" style=\"float:left; width:25%;\">\n                                                    <img src=\"/artistimgs/201605/07/2570_Richard_Wermeling.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Wermeling\" align=\"left\" style=\"margin:0px 10px 10px 10px;\">\n                                            </div>\n                    <div style=\"float:left; width:70%;\">\n                        <span style=\"font-size:14px;\">Richie Wermerlingrw blue straight on came to the forefront of the British music scene as lead singer, song writer and sometime producer of the successful 90s band Let Loose, and more recently as songwriter, producer, singer and keyboardist for the band Bottlefly.

Nicknamed \"Lady Day\" by her friend and music partner Lester Young, Holiday had a seminal influence on jazz music and pop singing. Her vocal style, strongly inspired by jazz instrumentalists, pioneered a new way of manipulating phrasing and tempo. Holiday was known for her vocal delivery and improvisational skills, which made up for her limited range and lack of formal music education. While there were other jazz singers with equal talent, Billie Holiday had a voice that captured the attention of her audience.<br>\n<br>\nAfter a turbulent childhood, Holiday began singing in nightclubs around Harlem. After being heard by producer John Hammond, who commended her voice, Holiday was signed to Brunswick Records in 1935. Collaborations with Teddy Wilson yielded the hit \"What a Little Moonlight Can Do\", which would later become a jazz standard. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Holiday booked mainstream success with labels such as Columbia Records and Decca Records. By the late 1940s, however, Holiday was beset with legal troubles and drug abuse. After a short prison sentence, Holiday performed a sold-out concert at Carnegie Hall. However, due to her drug and alcohol problems, her reputation deteriorated.</span>\n                        <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n                                                    <div class=\"sheetItem\">\n                                <div class=\"sheetinfo\">\n                                    <div class=\"sheetinfotop\">\n                                        <a href=\"/piano/sheets/45113/Billie_Holliday_Ill_Be_Seeing_You.html\">I'll Be Seeing You Sheet Music</a>\n                                    </div>\n                                    <div class=\"sheetinfobottom\">\n                                        &nbsp;\n                                    </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n                            </div>\n                                            </div>\n                    <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n               </div>\n                            <div style=\"width:98%; padding:10px; margin:0px; border-bottom: 1px solid maroon;\">\n                    <div style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight:bold; margin:15px 0px;\">IL Divo</div>\n                    <div class=\"artistinfo\" style=\"float:left; width:25%;\">\n                                                    <img src=\"/artistimgs/201011/25/403_IL_Divo.jpg\" alt=\"IL Divo\" align=\"left\" style=\"margin:0px 10px 10px 10px;\">\n                                            </div>\n                    <div style=\"float:left; width:70%;\">\n                        <span style=\"font-size:14px;\">Il Divo, Italian for \"divine male performer\", is a multinational operatic pop vocal group created by pop impresario Simon Cowell, and signed to the Sony BMG music label.

Aware of this new appreciation for lyrical voices and classical music, he decided to form a multinational quartet (the members hail from Spain, Switzerland, France, and the United States) that tried to sound like The Three Tenors.<br>\n<br>\nSimon Cowell conducted a worldwide search for young singers who were willing to embark on the Il Divo project which lasted two years , from 2001 until December 2003, when the fourth member of Il Divo, American tenor David Miller, was signed.

His professional career had stalled by the 1950s, but it was reborn in 1954 after he won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.<br>\n<br>\nHe signed with Capitol Records and released several critically lauded albums (such as In the Wee Small Hours, Songs for Swingin' Lovers, Come Fly with Me, Only the Lonely and Nice 'n' Easy). Sinatra left Capitol to found his own record label, Reprise Records (finding success with albums such as Ring-A-Ding-Ding, Sinatra at the Sands and Francis Albert Sinatra &amp; Antonio Carlos Jobim), toured internationally, and fraternized with the Rat Pack and President John F. Kennedy in the early 1960s. Sinatra turned 50 in 1965, recorded the retrospective September of My Years, starred in the Emmy-winning television special Frank Sinatra: A Man and His Music, and scored hits with \"Strangers in the Night\" and \"My Way\".<br>\n<br>\nSinatra attempted to weather the changing tastes in popular music, but with dwindling album sales and after appearing in several poorly received films, he retired in 1971. Coming out of retirement in 1973, he recorded several albums, scoring a hit with \"(Theme From) New York, New York\" in 1980, and toured both within the United States and internationally until a few years before his death in 1998.<br>\n<br>\nSinatra also forged a career as a dramatic actor, winning the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in From Here to Eternity, and he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for The Man with the Golden Arm.

Its follow-up, A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002) won multiple awards such as NME's Album of the Year and was later included on Rolling Stone magazine's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list, ranking at #473. Their next release, X&amp;Y (2005), received a slightly less enthusiastic yet still generally positive reception. The band's fourth studio album, Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends (2008), was produced by Brian Eno and released again to largely favourable reviews. All of Coldplay's albums have enjoyed great commercial success.<br>\n<br>\nColdplay's early material was compared to acts such as Jeff Buckley, U2, and Travis.

Benny Andersson, Björn Ulvaeus, Anni-Frid Lyngstad (Frida), Agnetha Fältskog are in ABBA. They topped the charts worldwide from the mid-1970s to the early 1980s. The name \"ABBA\" is an acronym formed from the first letters of each of the group member's given name (Agnetha, Björn, Benny, Anni-Frid).<br>\n<br>\nABBA gained immense international popularity employing catchy song hooks, simple lyrics, and a Wall of Sound achieved by overdubbing the female singers' voices in multiple harmonies. As their popularity grew, they were sought-after to tour Europe, Australia, and North America, drawing crowds of near-hysterical fans (\"ABBAholics\"), notably in Australia. Touring became a contentious issue, being particularly unpopular with Agnetha, but they continued to release studio albums to great commercial success. At the height of their popularity, however, both marriages of the band members (Benny with Frida, and Björn with Agnetha) failed, and the relationship changes were reflected in their music, as they produced more thoughtful lyrics with different compositions.<br>\n<br>\nThey remain a fixture of radio playlists and are one of the world's best selling bands, having sold around 400 million records world wide; The music of ABBA has been re-arranged into the successful musical Mamma Mia! that has toured worldwide and a movie version was released in July 2008. All four of the former members of ABBA were present at the Stockholm premieres of both the musical (2005) and the film (2008).

The band consists of vocalist Dolores O'Riordan, guitarist Noel Hogan, bassist Mike Hogan and drummer Fergal Lawler. Although widely associated with alternative rock, the band's sound also incorporates indie pop, post-punk, Irish folk and pop rock elements.<br>\n<br>\nThe Cranberries rose to international fame in the 1990s with their debut album, Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?, which became a commercial success. The group was one of the most successful rock acts of the '90s and sold over 40 million albums worldwide. The band has achieved four top 20 albums on the Billboard 200 chart (Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?; No Need to Argue; To the Faithful Departed and Bury the Hatchet) and eight top 20 singles on the Modern Rock Tracks chart (\"Linger\", \"Dreams\", \"Zombie\", \"Ode to My Family\", \"Ridiculous Thoughts\", \"Salvation\", \"Free to Decide\" and \"Promises\").<br>\n<br>\nIn early 2010, after a six-year hiatus, The Cranberries reunited and began a North American tour, followed by shows in Latin America and Europe. The band recorded their sixth album Roses in May 2011, and released it on 27 February 2012.</span>\n                        <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n                                                    <div class=\"sheetItem\">\n                                <div class=\"sheetinfo\">\n                                    <div class=\"sheetinfotop\">\n                                        <a href=\"/piano/sheets/45069/The_Cranberries_Dreams.html\">Dreams Sheet Music</a>\n                                    </div>\n                                    <div class=\"sheetinfobottom\">\n                                        &nbsp;\n                                    </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n                            </div>\n                                            </div>\n                    <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n               </div>\n                            <div style=\"width:98%; padding:10px; margin:0px; border-bottom: 1px solid maroon;\">\n                    <div style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight:bold; margin:15px 0px;\">G S Monks</div>\n                    <div class=\"artistinfo\" style=\"float:left; width:25%;\">\n                                            </div>\n                    <div style=\"float:left; width:70%;\">\n                        <span style=\"font-size:14px;\"></span>\n                        <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n                                                    <div class=\"sheetItem\">\n                                <div class=\"sheetinfo\">\n                                    <div class=\"sheetinfotop\">\n                                        <a href=\"/piano/sheets/45119/G_S_Monks_Piano_Book_1.html\">Piano Book #1 Sheet Music</a>\n                                    </div>\n                                    <div class=\"sheetinfobottom\">\n                                        &nbsp;\n                                    </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n                            </div>\n                                            </div>\n                    <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n               </div>\n                            <div style=\"width:98%; padding:10px; margin:0px; border-bottom: 1px solid maroon;\">\n                    <div style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight:bold; margin:15px 0px;\">Bill Evans</div>\n                    <div class=\"artistinfo\" style=\"float:left; width:25%;\">\n                                                    <img src=\"/artistimgs/201201/25/2307_Bill_Evans.jpg\" alt=\"Bill Evans\" align=\"left\" style=\"margin:0px 10px 10px 10px;\">\n                                            </div>\n                    <div style=\"float:left; width:70%;\">\n                        <span style=\"font-size:14px;\">William John Evans, known as Bill Evans (August 16, 1929 – September 15, 1980) was an American jazz pianist. His use of impressionist harmony, inventive interpretation of traditional jazz repertoire, and trademark rhythmically independent, \"singing\" melodic lines influenced a generation of pianists, including Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock, John Taylor, Steve Kuhn, Don Friedman, Denny Zeitlin, Bobo Stenson and Keith Jarrett, as well as guitarists Lenny Breau and Pat Metheny. The music of Bill Evans continues to inspire younger pianists like Marcin Wasilewski, Fred Hersch, Ray Reach, Bill Charlap, Lyle Mays, Eliane Elias and arguably Brad Mehldau, early in his career.<br>\n<br>\nEvans is an inductee of the Down Beat Jazz Hall of Fame.<br>\n</span>\n                        <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n                                                    <div class=\"sheetItem\">\n                                <div class=\"sheetinfo\">\n                                    <div class=\"sheetinfotop\">\n                                        <a href=\"/piano/sheets/45079/Bill_Evans_Danny_Boy.html\">Danny Boy Sheet Music</a>\n                                    </div>\n                                    <div class=\"sheetinfobottom\">\n                                        &nbsp;\n                                    </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n                            </div>\n                                            </div>\n                    <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n               </div>\n                            <div style=\"width:98%; padding:10px; margin:0px; border-bottom: 1px solid maroon;\">\n                    <div style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight:bold; margin:15px 0px;\">Sara Bareilles</div>\n                    <div class=\"artistinfo\" style=\"float:left; width:25%;\">\n                                                    <img src=\"/artistimgs/201011/25/490_Sara_Bareilles.jpg\" alt=\"Sara Bareilles\" align=\"left\" style=\"margin:0px 10px 10px 10px;\">\n                                            </div>\n                    <div style=\"float:left; width:70%;\">\n                        <span style=\"font-size:14px;\">Sara Beth Bareilles (born December 7, 1979) is an American singer-songwriter and pianist. She achieved mainstream success in 2007 with the hit single \"Love Song\", which brought her into the number one spot on the Billboard Pop 100 chart.<br>\n<br>\nAfter graduating from college in 2002, Bareilles performed at local bars and clubs (such as the Hotel Cafe and Genghis Cohen in Los Angeles), building a following, before performing in larger venues. She issued two demos of mostly live tracks in 2003: The First One in April and The Summer Sessions in October. In 2004, she appeared as a singer in a bar in the indie film Girl Play, performing the song \"Undertow\".<br>\n<br>\nIn January 2004, Bareilles released her first studio album, Careful Confessions. She signed a contract with Epic Records' A&amp;R executive Pete Giberga on April 15, 2005. The remainder of the year and early 2006 were spent writing and reworking songs for her upcoming album. Her song, \"Gravity,\" appears briefly in the 2006 independent film Loving Annabelle. She also toured as the opening act in 2006 for Marc Broussard's \"Carencro\" tour.<br>\n<br>\nIn mid-2004 she opened for Rocco DeLuca and the Burden during their inaugural headline tour, supported Guster on their first UK tour and co-headlined a tour with Jon McLaughlin. In 2007, Bareilles toured as the opening act for Aqualung and Mika, and later that year opened for several shows on both Maroon 5 and Paolo Nutini's U.S. tours. She also opened for James Blunt on his U.S. Tour in association with VH1 You Oughta Know.</span>\n                        <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n                                                    <div class=\"sheetItem\">\n                                <div class=\"sheetinfo\">\n                                    <div class=\"sheetinfotop\">\n                                        <a href=\"/piano/sheets/44983/Sara_Bareilles_Many_The_Miles.html\">Many The Miles Sheet Music</a>\n                                    </div>\n                                    <div class=\"sheetinfobottom\">\n                                        &nbsp;\n                                    </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n                            </div>\n                                            </div>\n                    <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n               </div>\n                            <div style=\"width:98%; padding:10px; margin:0px; border-bottom: 1px solid maroon;\">\n                    <div style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight:bold; margin:15px 0px;\">That Thing You Do!</div>\n                    <div class=\"artistinfo\" style=\"float:left; width:25%;\">\n                                                    <img src=\"/artistimgs/201604/30/2540_That_Thing_You_Do.jpg\" alt=\"That Thing You Do!\" align=\"left\" style=\"margin:0px 10px 10px 10px;\">\n                                            </div>\n                    <div style=\"float:left; width:70%;\">\n                        <span style=\"font-size:14px;\">That Thing You Do! is a 1996 American musical comedy drama film written by, directed by, and co-starring Tom Hanks.
