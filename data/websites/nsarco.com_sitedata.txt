A large number of our clients register their dogs as Certified Service Animals not just to accompany them into stores, restaurants, motels, or on airline flights (for no extra cost), but to successfully qualify for housing where pets aren't allowed. Our Service Dog Certification documents formalize and simplify these processes and make qualifying for special housing hassle-free. If you and your service dog become certified with NSAR, both of you are immediately protected under federal law (ADA).</p>\n\n<p>We also specialize in registering dogs, cats, and other animals as Emotional Support Animals (ESA) for people with emotional or psychological disabilities. Although ESAs have fewer protections under federal law, they are allowed to fly in the cabin of an aircraft with their disabled handler and to qualify for \"no pet\" or \"limited pet\" housing. <a href=\"/emotional-support-info.html\">Click here</a> to find out more.</p>\n\n<p style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a href=\"/nsar-registration-kit.html\">Complete Service Animal Certification Kit</a> - <span class=\"alertmsg\">ONLY $64.95!</span></p>\n\n<p><strong class=\"head\">Not All Disabilities Are Visible</strong><br>\nMost people think of a service dog as a large breed dog for the blind or for working with a person confined to a wheelchair. The reality is that the majority of certified service dogs are small dogs that perform tasks for otherwise normal people with disorders related to emotional, psychological, hearing, seizure, diabetic, or for other medical issues - disabilities that are completely invisible. Many people aren't aware that they qualify for a certified service dog or other animal because they don't realize the problems they have are considered a disability. <a href=\"/list-of-disabilities.html\">Click here to see if you qualify as disabled</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong class=\"head\">What Does the Law Say?</strong><br>\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ada.gov/cguide.htm\">The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</a> protects people with all kinds of disabilities (obvious disabilities, as well as the invisible kind) by requiring all businesses that serve the public to allow people with disabilities to bring their service animals with them. That means restaurants, hotels, retail stores, taxicabs, theaters, concert halls, sports facilities, and airlines - just about any place you can imagine. If the public has access to it, then so do you and your service dog. By law, these businesses can't charge you extra or separate you from other customers because of your certified service dog. And by law, businesses aren't allowed to ask you to prove your dog is a service animal, although that doesn't guarantee they won't ask. By certifying your dog with NSAR, you'll have all the documentation you need should someone confront you. If your dog has a Service Animal patch and photo ID card displayed, 99.9% of businesses won't even bother to ask about your dog. <a href=\"/register-your-animal.html\">We can help you qualify!</a></p>\n\n<p><img class=\"img-right\" src=\"/images/dog-in-suitcase.jpg\" alt=\"National Service Animal Registry\" title=\"National Service Animal Registry\" width=\"200\"><strong class=\"head\">Choose your Registration Company Carefully</strong><br>\nThere are several service animal registries operating online that offer various services, but unfortunately, they are not all created equal. Some companies charge outrageous fees for their services, while others accept only checks and money orders, but after taking your money you never hear from them again. We encourage you to verify that the business you choose is legitimate, one that you can actually call that has a representative you can speak with. We welcome you to call our friendly and knowledgeable service animal experts toll free: <b>866-737-3930</b></p>\n\n<p><strong class=\"head\">NSAR Registration Kit</strong><br>\nThe NSAR registration kit is a complete package with everything you need to officially identify your service animal and take full advantage of the laws protecting people with a disability. Advantages such us qualifying for housing where pets aren't allowed, taking your service animal anywhere the public can go, and airline and other travel with your service dog.
