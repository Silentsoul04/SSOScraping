An Order may take the form of: (a) an electronic form (e.g., an order placed online through a Frontline website), (b) an order form generated by Frontline and executed by both parties or (c) a purchase order that you submit and pursuant to which you are provided access to the Services. Unless you have entered into a separate Frontline Customer Agreement, your access to and use of any Services is governed by the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the applicable Order, provided however that the only terms contained in a purchase order that will have any force or effect are the Services ordered and the price to be paid. All other terms contained in any purchase order are hereby rejected. All fees and charges will be set forth in the applicable Order(s). Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Order(s), Frontline will invoice you in US Dollars and you will pay all fees, charges, and expenses within thirty days of the date of an invoice via check or ACH.

You agree that Frontline is not required to provide you any additional notice. Your agreement with your credit card issuer governs your use of the designated credit card and you must refer to that agreement to determine your rights and liabilities in connection with your use of your credit card. You agree to immediately notify Frontline of any change in your billing address or the credit card used for payment hereunder.</p><h4>8.4.\tTaxes.</h4><p>Frontline's fees are net of any applicable sales tax. If any Services, or payments for any Services, under this Agreement are subject to sales tax in any jurisdiction and you have not remitted the applicable sales tax to Frontline, you will be responsible for the payment of such sales tax and any related penalties or interest to the relevant tax authority, and you will indemnify Frontline for any liability or expense we may incur in connection with such sales tax. Upon our request, you will provide us with official receipts issued by the appropriate taxing authority, or other such evidence that you have paid all applicable taxes. For purposes of this Section, you agree to make all payments of fees to Frontline free and clear of, and without reduction for, any withholding taxes. Any such taxes imposed on payments of fees to Frontline will be your sole responsibility, and you will provide Frontline with official receipts issued by the appropriate taxing authority, or such other evidence as we may reasonably request, to establish that such taxes have been paid.</p><h4>8.5.\tThird Party Provider.</h4><p>Frontline uses PayPal or CyberSource (each, a <strong>\"Payment Service Provider\"</strong>) as third party service providers for payment services (e.g., card acceptance, merchant settlement, and related services).

IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH FRONTLINE AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.</p><h4>16.1.\tApplicability of Arbitration Agreement</h4><p>You agree that any dispute or claim relating in any way to your access or use of the Frontline Technology, or to any aspect of your relationship with Frontline, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (1) you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify, so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis; and (2) you or Frontline may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). <strong>This Arbitration Agreement will apply, without limitation, to all claims that arose or were asserted before the Effective Date of this Agreement or any prior version of this Agreement.</strong></p><p><strong>IF YOU AGREE TO ARBITRATION WITH FRONTLINE, YOU ARE AGREEING IN ADVANCE THAT YOU WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN OR SEEK TO RECOVER MONETARY OR OTHER RELIEF IN ANY LAWSUIT FILED AGAINST FRONTLINE ALLEGING CLASS, COLLECTIVE, AND/OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIMS ON YOUR BEHALF. INSTEAD, BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATION, YOU MAY BRING YOUR CLAIMS AGAINST FRONTLINE IN AN INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION PROCEEDING. IF SUCCESSFUL ON SUCH CLAIMS, YOU COULD BE AWARDED MONEY OR OTHER RELIEF BY AN ARBITRATOR. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT YOU MAY CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY IN DECIDING WHETHER TO ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.</strong></p><h4>16.2.\tArbitration Rules and Forum</h4><p>The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent, The Corporation Trust Company, at Corporation Trust Center, 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, DE 19801. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys' fees and interest, will be subject to JAMS's most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at <a href=\"http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/\">http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/</a>; all other claims will be subject to JAMS's most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at <a href=\"http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/\">http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/</a>. JAMS's rules are also available at <a href=\"http://www.jamsadr.com\">www.jamsadr.com</a> or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the Parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS's filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, Frontline will pay them for you. In addition, Frontline will reimburse all such JAMS's filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, Frontline will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous</p><p>You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p><h4>16.3.\tAuthority of Arbitrator.</h4><p>The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Frontline. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum's rules, and the Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.</p><h4>16.4.\tWaiver of Jury Trial.</h4><p>YOU AND FRONTLINE HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and Frontline are instead electing that all claims and disputes will be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 16.1 above. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.</p><h4>16.5.\tWaiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.</h4><p>ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. In the event that this subparagraph is deemed invalid or unenforceable neither you nor Frontline are entitled to arbitration and instead claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in Section 17.</p><h4>16.6.\t30-Day Right to Opt Out.</h4><p>You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to (a) the following address: Frontline, Attn: General Counsel, 1400 Atwater Drive, Malvern, PA 19355, or (b) the following email address: <a href=\"mailto:arbitration-opt-out@frontlineed.com\">arbitration-opt-out@frontlineed.com</a>, within 30 days after first becoming subject to this Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, your Frontline username (if any), the email address you used to set up your Frontline account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with Frontline.</p><h4>16.7.\tSeverability</h4><p>If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts will be of no force and effect and will be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement will continue in full force and effect.</p><h4>16.8.\tModification.</h4><p>Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, Frontline agrees that if Frontline makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, it will not apply to any individual claim(s) that you had already provided notice of to Frontline.</p></div><div><h3>17.\tGeneral.</h3><p>Frontline and you are each independent contractors and neither Party will be, nor represent itself to be, the franchiser, partner, broker, employee, servant, agent, or legal representative of the other Party for any purpose whatsoever. You may not sublicense, assign, or transfer this Agreement, or any rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or in part, without Frontline's prior written consent. Any attempted assignment in violation of this Section will be void. This Agreement will be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the permitted successors and assigns of each Party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except for your obligations to pay amounts due under this Agreement, neither Party will be deemed to be in default of any provision of this Agreement for any delay, error, failure, or interruption of performance due to any act of God, terrorism, war, strike, or other labor or civil disturbance, interruption of power service, interruption of communications services, problems with the Internet, act of any other person not under the control of such Party, or other similar cause. This Agreement may be amended only by written agreement of the Parties, and any attempted amendment in violation of this Section will be void. The waiver or failure of either Party to exercise in any respect any right provided under this Agreement will not be deemed a waiver of such right in the future or a waiver of any other rights established under this Agreement. To the extent the Parties are permitted under this Agreement to initiate litigation in a court, both you and Frontline agree that all claims and disputes arising out of or relating to the Agreement will be litigated exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This Agreement does not confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the Parties, except Frontline's licensors. When used herein, the words \"includes\" and \"including\" and their syntactical variations will be deemed followed by the words \"without limitation.\"</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></ui-view></div><div class=\"row footer\"><footer><div class=\"col-sm-12 center-block\"><div class=\"dark fl-logo\"><span>Frontline Education</span></div><div class=\"site-links\"><ul><li class=\"about\"><a href=\"http://www.frontlineeducation.com/\" target=\"_blank\" translate=\"\" class=\"ng-scope\">Footer.AboutFrontline</a></li><li class=\"terms\"><a href=\"https://login.frontlineeducation.com/ui/#/terms\" translate=\"\" class=\"ng-scope\">Footer.TermsAndConditions</a></li><li class=\"copyright ng-scope\" translate=\"\" translate-value-current-year=\"2017\">Footer.Copyright</li></ul></div></div></footer></div></div></div></ui-view>\n    <script src=\"/ui/config.js?v=1492804655712\"></script>\n    <script src=\"/ui/global-vendor.js?v=1492804655712\"></script>\n    <script src=\"/ui/fl-auth-ng.js?v=1492804655712\"></script>\n    <script src=\"/ui/global-app.js?v=1492804655712\"></script>\n    <script>\n        var config = window.siteConfig;\n        config.cacheStamp = '1492804655712';\n        angular.module('idm-common').constant(\"idmConfig\", config);\n    </script>\n\n    <!--[if (gt IE 9)|!(IE)]>-->\n        \n    <!--<![endif]-->\n\n \n\n\n</body>"}
