It is a multi-player event-driven simulator written in C++ that models raid damage.</p>\n      \n    </div>\n\n\n      <div id=\"home-toc\" class=\"section section-open final grid\">\n  \t\t<h2 id=\"welcome\">Welcome</h2>\n\n<p>Increasing class synergy and the prevalence of proc-based combat modifiers have eroded the accuracy of traditional calculators that rely upon closed-form approximations to model very complex mechanics. The goal of this simulator is to close the accuracy gap while maintaining a performance level high enough to calculate relative stat weights to aid gear selection.</p>\n\n<p>The primary purpose of this site is to host sample analysis generated by SimulationCraft. This provides players with easy access to simulation results at various gear points and patch levels.</p>\n\n<p>It is important that information flow in both directions. After examining the reports, players may detect <strong>inconsistencies</strong> with their experiences in-game. In addition, <b>inefficiencies</b> (talents, glyphs, gear, gems, enchants) may be found in the supplied profiles. <b>Please</b> take the time to open an <a href=\"https://github.com/simulationcraft/simc/issues\"><strong>issue</strong></a>. We are continuously looking for new profiles, both at the normal and heroic levels.</p>\n\n<p>If you need help on running SimulationCraft, developing custom actions lists, or have other questions, please see our <a href=\"https://github.com/simulationcraft/simc/wiki/StartersGuide\">extensive documentation</a>.
