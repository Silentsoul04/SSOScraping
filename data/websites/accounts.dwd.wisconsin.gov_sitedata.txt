If you need a Logon after the original is\n                    deleted, you will need to create a new Logon and request the required access.\n                </p>\n                <h2>Introduction</h2>\n                <p>\n                    Many State agencies provide information and services by the Internet. Much of\n                    the information and many of the services do not include personal or confidential\n                    information, and are available to anyone accessing the State's Portal or agency\n                    Web sites. When access to information or services is restricted to protect your\n                    privacy or the privacy of others, you may be asked to provide a DWD/Wisconsin\n                    Logon, consisting of a Username and Password. Your DWD/Wisconsin Logon allows us\n                    to provide you with access to your information and services, while restricting\n                    access by unauthorized individuals.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    If you choose to accept the conditions of this user acceptance agreement, you\n                    will be prompted to provide the basic information that is required to issue a\n                    DWD/Wisconsin Logon. The information you provide will be stored in your Logon\n                    Profile and will be managed according to the State's policy, as described below.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    To create your DWD/Wisconsin Logon, you will be asked for your name, e-mail\n                    address (optional but required for self-service if you forget your Password),\n                    telephone number (optional), mailing address (optional), your desired Username\n                    and Password, and a security question and answer. The security question and answer\n                    is required to look up your Username or Password if you forget them. You will also\n                    have the ability to review, delete or update the information stored in your Logon\n                    Profile.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    Some State Internet services may require additional information in order to validate\n                    your identity. For example, some services may require additional forms of identification\n                    such as date of birth or social security number. You will always have the choice to opt\n                    out and not provide the requested information. However, if you do so, you may not be able\n                    to complete your transaction over the Internet. Your Logon Profile will never contain this\n                    information, nor will your Profile contain records such as driving history, tax\n                    information, unemployment compensation, vehicle registrations, or prison records.\n                </p>\n                <h2>Protecting Your Logon</h2>\n                <p>\n                    Your Username and Password are your keys to doing secure\n                    business with the State of Wisconsin over the Internet. They should be\n                    considered as important as your signature. Do not share your\n                    Username or Password with anyone.

At the same time, there are exceptions to this law that serve\n                    various needs, including the privacy of individuals.
