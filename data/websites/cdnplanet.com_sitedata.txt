Tata CDN does not differentiate based on file size or type unless it is specifically configured to do so (customers can't tweak this self, Tata support is needed). The CDN passes along the <code>Accept-Encoding</code> header from client to origin. If the origin does not send compressed to CDN, the CDN will not send compressed to clients (unless you use their Intelligent Origin Access service which costs extra).] purge:map[moreinfo:Tata does not accept purge requests containing internationalized characters like <code>è ó ö À</code>. The solution is to encode the path to the file, like so for example with JavaScript: <code>encodeURI(&quot;/images/ståle/1.png&quot;)</code>. The result will be <code>&quot;/images/st%C3%A5le/1.png&quot;</code> and Tata purging works with this.<br>From experience, we know purging happens fast across all POPs almost always. However, it is too bad Tata gives no insight into if and when the purge has happened. The good news is that Tata serves responses with the Age header, e.g. <code>Age: 69714</code>. This tells you the number of seconds the object has been in cache. If you see <code>Age: 0</code> you know TATA just fetched the object from origin. You can easily check the Age header value with curl.
