Surely you don't want to have your offer displayed 10 times all on the same screen and frustrate people. However, long pages are becoming the norm and the idea of squeezing everything \"above the fold\" is fading.

In order to communicate this clearly to your users, the styles of your clickable actions (links, buttons), selected elements (chosen items), and plain text should be clearly distinct from one another and then applied consistently across an interface. In the visual example, I've chosen a blue color to suggest anything that can be clicked on, and black as anything that has been selected or indicates where someone is. When applied properly, people will more easily learn and use these cues to navigate your interface.

Instead, a sign up process takes effort and is often associated with lengthy forms of some sort. The hypothesis set here is that buttons which reinforce a benefit might lead to higher conversions.

When displaying lists of data for example, we typically want to allow the user to do something with the items in the list. Clicking on, or hovering over an item in this list can be used to express that a particular item is to be manipulated (deleted, renamed, etc.). Another example of common direct manipulation would be clicking on a data item (say a text based address) which then turns into an editable field. Enabling such interactions cuts through the number of required steps, compared to if the same task was started more generally without the context of the item - since selection is already taken care of. Do keep in mind of course that for generic item-agnostic actions, there is nothing wrong with contextless menus.\n</span>\n<img src=\"/images/idea019.png\" class=\"ideaimg\">\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><h2 id=\"20\"><a href=\"#20\">Try <span class=\"textStrong\">Exposing Fields</span> instead of creating extra pages.</a></h2><a class=\"tweet\" src=\"images/tweet.png\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Try%20Exposing Fields%20GoodUI.org/%2320\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share\"></a>\n<img alt=\"conversion tip\" src=\"/images/labelConv.png\" class=\"label\">\n<span class=\"description\">\n<a href=\"http://www.goodui.org/evidence/?20\" class=\"emphasizeEVID\">Evidence Exists For A <span class=\"EVIDneg\">-0.2%</span> Effect From This Idea</a><br>\nWhen creating landing pages that convey value, it can be beneficial to show the actual form fields on the conversion page itself.  Merging the sign up form with the landing page comes with a number of benefits in comparison to creating separate multi-page sign ups. First, we are cutting out extra steps from the flow in general and the task at hand takes less time. Secondly, by showing the number of form fields right there, we are also providing the customer with a sense of how long the sign up actually is.

Attention of course is a precious resource since we can only grasp so much at any given time. Surely borders can be used to define a space very clearly and precisely, but they also do cost us cognitive energy as they are perceived as explicit lines. In order to define relationships between screen elements which use less attention, elements can also be just grouped together through proximity, be aligned, have distinct backgrounds, or even just share a similar typographic style. When working in abstract UI tools, it’s easy to drop a bunch of boxes everywhere. Boxes however come with a false sense of being immune from the order and unity which governs the rest of the screen. Hence pages with lots of boxes sometimes may tend to look noisy or misaligned. Sometimes it is helpful to throw in a line here and there, but do consider alternative ways of defining visual relationships that are less taxing to attention and your content will come through.\n</span>\n<img src=\"/images/idea023.png\" class=\"ideaimg\">\n</li>\n\n\n\n\n<li><h2 id=\"24\"><a href=\"#24\">Try <span class=\"textStrong\">Selling Benefits</span> instead of features.</a></h2><a class=\"tweet\" src=\"images/tweet.png\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Try%20Selling Benefits%20GoodUI.org/%2324\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share\"></a>\n<img alt=\"conversion tip\" src=\"/images/labelConv.png\" class=\"label\">\n<span class=\"description\">\n<a href=\"http://www.goodui.org/evidence/?24\" class=\"emphasizeEVID\">Evidence Exists For A <span class=\"EVIDpos\">+4.3%</span> Effect From This Idea</a><br>\nI think this is Marketing 101.

We often forget to design for this initial case when there is still nothing to display whatsoever, and by doing so we run the risk of neglecting users. A zero data world is a cold place. When first time users look at your app and all it does is show a blank slate without any guidance then you’re probably missing out on an opportunity.

Alternatively, there is also the more traditional opt-in strategy that requires people to first take an action in order to take part in or receive something.  \n\nThere are two good reasons why opt-out works better than opt-in. First it alleviates resistance on the path of action, as the user does not have to do anything. Secondly, it’s also a form of recommendation which implies some kind of a norm - “since everyone else takes this as it is, I might also do the same”. \n\nOf course the opt-out strategy is often perceived as controversial as there are those sleazy marketers which will abuse it. One such evil is to diminish the readability of the opt-out text, while another is to use confusing text, such as double negatives. Both examples will result in users being less aware of actually signing up for something. \n\nHence to keep the ethics in check, if you do decide to go with an opt-out approach, do make it very clear and understandable to your customers what they are being defaulted into.

Having a more consistent UI or interaction is simply a great way to decrease the amount of learning someone has to go through as they use an interface or product. As we press buttons and shift sliders, we learn to expect these interaction elements to look, behave and be found in the same way repeatedly. Consistency solidifies the way we learn to interact and as soon as it is taken away, we are then forced back into learning mode all over again. Consistent interfaces can be achieved through a wide possible range of things such as: colors, directions, behaviors, positioning, size, shape, labelling and language.\n\nBefore we make everything consistent however, please let’s bear in mind that keeping things inconsistent still has value. Inconsistent elements or behaviors come out into attention from the depths of our habitual subconscious - which can be a good thing when you want to have things get noticed.

Scarcity suggests there was once more of something, today there is less of it, and tomorrow it might shrink yet even further. Think of a wholesale store vs. a boutique one and then look at how their pricing often compares. Then think back to the wholesaler and notice one scarcity strategy that they apply nevertheless, in light of having a wider product offering. Some wholesalers or mega retailers will actually do limited products that are only available until they are bought out, without replenishing the supply. In software, we often forget about scarcity because more often than not, bits and bytes can be so easily duplicated and there is so much abundance with the help of copy-paste. Nevertheless, in the world of UI, scarcity can still be used to show limits or bottlenecks that relate to the real world. Think of the limits behind the number of tickets you can sell to a webinar, the number of clients you can service in a month, or the number physical products you might have before the next batch is produced. All these things can be shown to the user to evoke action while being more informed. Think supply and demand. Think less is more.\n</span>\n<img src=\"/images/idea036.png\" class=\"ideaimg\">\n</li>\n\n\n\n\n\n<li><h2 id=\"37\"><a href=\"#37\">Try <span class=\"textStrong\">Recognition</span> instead of recall.</a></h2><a class=\"tweet\" src=\"images/tweet.png\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Try%20Recognition%20GoodUI.org/%2337\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share\"></a>\n<img src=\"/images/labelEase.png\" class=\"label\">\n<img alt=\"conversion tip\" src=\"/images/labelConv.png\" class=\"label2\">\n<span class=\"description\">\n<a href=\"http://www.goodui.org/evidence/?37\" class=\"emphasizeEVID\">Evidence Exists For A <span class=\"EVIDpos\">+10%</span> Effect From This Idea</a><br>\nThis is a classic principle of design tied strongly to psychology which suggests that it is easier to recognize something existing, as opposed to having to recall it purely from one’s own memory.

This might be the reason why sometimes multiple choice questions on exams can be faster to complete than open ended ones.

Big commitments can scare people off. Borrowing from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cialdini\">Robert Cialdini’s</a> work, using commitment is a powerful persuasion strategy which taps into people’s desire to be seen as having a consistent self image. That quest for consistency suggests that generally people can climb a series of smaller and connected actions more easily than one larger one. An application stemming from this is known as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot-in-the-door_technique\">foot in the door technique</a> which works by “getting a small 'yes' and then getting an even bigger 'yes.'”. One example of this would be a dating site that is asking people to just look around, followed by an introduction task, followed by a couple ideas for a date, etc. This is opposite of course to asking the same users to lock into a marriage right away (nothing wrong with getting married). :) In the context of pricing, another example can be seen when we ask customers to pay a series of monthly fees instead of an annual one. A related tactic of lowering upfront commitment might also show a “no contract” messaging in order to make customers feel that they can leave anytime which further decreases the barrier to entry.\n</span>\n<img src=\"/images/idea044.png\" class=\"ideaimg\">\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><h2 id=\"45\"><a href=\"#45\">Try <span class=\"textStrong\">Softer Prompts</span> instead of modal windows.</a></h2><a class=\"tweet\" src=\"images/tweet.png\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Try%20Softer Prompts%20GoodUI.org/%2345\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share\"></a>\n<img src=\"/images/labelEase.png\" class=\"label\">\n<span class=\"description\">\nThe modal window or dialog box is an attention hog, like it or not.

Too much clutter may burn through our limited attention pools and the more parts there are, the more room for usability issues to creep up. One way for the user interface to achieve the same with less is to make UI controls more multifunctional. That is, you take one control and you squeeze two or more functions into it. As one example, we can combine a search input field with a filtering mechanism that affects a list below right as you type. This removes the need for additional filters. We can also combine a ranking display with a rating onhover function to further avoid additional parts.\n\nMultifunctionalism isn’t all that golden though. Although it simplifies, it does so at the cost of discoverability. Functions which are less visible up front run the risk of not being found. It’s therefore probably better to reserve the multifunctional approach for repeat visitors which can deal with a slightly higher learning curve.

Take a down arrow icon for example. Does it mean to move something down, lower its priority, or download? Or does an “x” icon mean to delete, disable, or close? The problem becomes larger for light use interfaces where there isn’t much time for the person to learn the meaning of the icons. To make the icons more understandable, they can be augmented with textual labels. If space is truly an issue, some user interfaces compromise by showing all of their icon labels on a single hover (less painful than having to hover on each individual icon).\n</span>\n<img src=\"/images/idea047.png\" class=\"ideaimg\">\n</li>\n\n\n\n\n<li><h2 id=\"48\"><a href=\"#48\">Try <span class=\"textStrong\">Natural Language</span> instead of dry text.</a></h2><a class=\"tweet\" src=\"images/tweet.png\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Try%20Natural Language%20GoodUI.org/%2348\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share\"></a>\n<img src=\"/images/labelEase.png\" class=\"label\">\n<img alt=\"conversion tip\" src=\"/images/labelConv.png\" class=\"label2\">\n<span class=\"description\">\n<a href=\"http://www.goodui.org/evidence/?48\" class=\"emphasizeEVID\">Evidence Exists For A <span class=\"EVIDpos\">+3.3%</span> Effect From This Idea</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_user_interface\">Natural language</a> is a more informal and conversational interaction style than just short, strict and formal words.

First, a person types in a phrase which the computer would ideally comprehend the full meaning of. Second, the responses by the computer are also more conversational and friendly in return. Although we might not be fully there yet with the first part, there are some basic and promising examples such as: searching for “toronto weather” in Google, Ubiquity for Firefox and Siri commands.

As obvious as it sounds, another sure shot way to fail at stirring curiosity (aside of not having it at all in the first place) is of course by providing the complete range of information or offering upfront.

When things are somewhat different, yet not really, it creates confusion as our minds try to make sense of the visual. This is why it's better to be purposeful about grouping things (or spacing them farther apart), using more diverse font sizes (or making them exactly the same), and using more diverse tones (or making them exactly the same).
