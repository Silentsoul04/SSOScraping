Unlike some applications that work with the secure FTP protocol, FreeFileSync eliminates the tedious and error-prone tasks of manually identifying files that have changed on the source computer and moving them to the target computer. FreeFileSync can recognize which files have changed, and move only those files to the target computer. Users can simply set up a mirror synchronization batch job, and run it each time files or folders need to be changed on the target computer.<br>\n<br>\nFreeFileSync can now detect moved files on the source computer, even for targets with no file-id support (for example, when using SFTP) or with unstable file-id support (when using FAT targets). This new capability delivers a significant performance boost under NTFS-to-SFTP and NTFS-to-FAT mirror scenarios. In addition, the software now has a folder picker that saves time when selecting SFTP paths.<br>\n<br>\nVersion 7.5 has enhanced its media transfer protocol (MTP) support, making it even easier for users to synchronize files and folders between their PCs and their iPhone, iPad, Android smartphone or tablet, digital camera, and other MTP devices. With its emphasis on fully integrating with Windows Explorer, the software allows users to see their MTP files with Explorer, open MTP files with their default application, preselect the active MTP folder in the folder-picker dialog, and drag and drop files and folders from Explorer into FreeFileSync. All of these features work with tablets, cameras, digital audio players, PDAs, and files on any device that supports the MTP protocol.<br>\n<br>\nFreeFileSync is available without cost. The software has been optimized for both CPU and File I/O performance, enabling it to scan a hard drive with hundreds of thousands of files in a few seconds. The fail-safe file copy design includes multiple strategies to prevent data corruption if the synchronization process is interrupted.<br>\n<br>\nThe application is designed for business and home computing users to perform routine file and folder backup and synchronization tasks. FreeFileSync makes it easy to synchronize files between two computers or between two hard drives on a single computer. FreeFileSync works with local drives, external drives, over a LAN, and with version 7.5, with SFTP and MTP protocols. Using FreeFileSync is as easy as choosing the two directories, selecting the synchronization settings, and clicking one button to compare the folders.<br>\n<br>\nFreeFileSync delivers features that are normally found in the premium versions of commercial applications. It can copy locked files, compare binary files, handle symbolic links and even process two-way synchronization challenges such as detecting conflicts and propagating deletions. FreeFileSync includes a library of graphs and messages that deliver unique feedback on multiple visual and textual levels. <br>\n<br>\nThe software allows users to create configuration files that let them immediately show the difference between two folders, or run a synchronization by simply double-clicking a configuration file. The latest version adds a new context menu option to create diffs by copying selected files to alternate folders. This new feature makes it simple for users to compare two folders, see which files have changed, and only copy the changed files to an external folder.<br>\n<br>\nFreeFileSync fully supports long file paths with more than 260 characters. The software effortlessly creates cross-platform copies among Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X, as well as iOS and Android devices that support MTP.<br>\n<br>\nFreeFileSync runs on Windows XP/Vista/7/8/8.1/10, Mac OS X 10.7 and newer, and all major distributions of Linux.

FreeFileSync is better than both of them for a number of reasons:<br><br>1. Intuitive user interface: I setup a multiple folder synchronisation within minutes! The buttons are clear, and if you aren't exactly sure of their function, hovering the mouse over the buttons will reveal clarifying information.<br><br>2. Informative: I knew exactly what files were being deleted or updated. The initial \"compare\" function is MUCH clearer and easier to use than Synkron's \"analysis\" function. Synkron would give no information about the analysis while it was occurring, so you don't know what progress it is making. FreeFileSync lets you know how the comparison is going, and gives a very handy graph to show progress, including file transfer rates, etc...<br><br>3. Stable: I have not yet had FreeFileSync crash on me. RichCopy and Synkron have both crashed, and Synkron tends to freeze the system.<br><br>4. Efficient: Synkron writes the synchronisation files to a backup file for some reason which I could not disable in the settings. This both slows the system down, but also uses up a significant amount of hard drive memory over time, since these files are not deleted. Quite simply the best free synchronisation software I have ever used!</div>\n\n\t<div class=\"review-box\"><p class=\"review-header\"><img src=\"/images/thumbs-up.png\" alt=\"Thumbs up\" title=\"Thumbs up\" style=\"vertical-align:middle\"> mutancik reviewed FreeFileSync:</p>\n\tIt is the ideal application to synchronize my files between two computers and one file server.

More importantly, it's very reliable: I synchronize about 250K files daily, with typically a few thousand changed and about a 500 MB in size and it has yet to mess up.<br><br>I used to use MS's SyncToy, but that name actually characterizes it all: a \"toy\". SyncToy would frequently get confused and want to move things in the wrong direction or show conflicts which weren't the case (esp. with MS network share drives).<br><br>One of FFS's strengths is how well it handles conflicts, though I have occasionally wished it had a one-click-for-the-newest button, it's really easy to select a group of files and right-click to send them left or right.<br><br>Also, FFS is orders of magnitude faster than Microsoft's SyncToy for high-latency drives, like WAN drives; synchronizations that would take several hours with SyncToy 2.1 completed in less than 20 minutes using FFS (and that was quite some versions of FSS ago).<br><br>The UI is adequate, with some very minor shortcomings, like not being able to reorder the list of directories being synchronized.

There is no comparison. FreeFileSync is one of finest and most important applications ever written. It works perfectly and handles a critically important computer task that too few people do. Vice Versa had at least one fatal flaw that was insurmountable: If folders had to be created on the destination side, they were created in all lower-case, regardless of the case of the source side. Consequently, the subsequent compare always failed. Their tech support was supposedly unaware of the problem, could not resolve it, and eventually avoided further contact.

This program is actually easier and simpler than copying folders by hand, because once you've set up your paths and saved them in profiles, you just choose the profile.

Allows you to add multiple, specific source and target folders and use filters to exclude and include specific files and/or sub-paths.<br><br>The generation of a batch script allows you to automate the synchronisation, which you set up in the GUI. It can then run regularly and in the background.<br><br>The synchronisation dialogue is beautiful, showing you the speed at which it happens. Display filters allow you to grasp the changes, and preview stats allow you to see the quantity of changes before-hand (so you don't make a mistake, moving the wrong way around for example).</div>\n\n\t<div class=\"review-box\"><p class=\"review-header\"><img src=\"/images/thumbs-up.png\" alt=\"Thumbs up\" title=\"Thumbs up\" style=\"vertical-align:middle\"> wchang778 reviewed FreeFileSync:</p>\n\tOne of the best sync programs I've found for Windows and Ubuntu.

I had started off with Synctoy hearing good things until I found out it won't copy files that are in use. Now I'm using FreeFileSync to sync my XBMC database from my media center to my regular PC. It works like a charm. I also use it to keep my music synced across 2 computers (I like having it in both places) as well as my Portable Apps. It reads the changes ridiculously quick, copies files in use, and the interface stays relatively responsive.</div>\n\n\t<div class=\"review-box\"><p class=\"review-header\"><img src=\"/images/thumbs-up.png\" alt=\"Thumbs up\" title=\"Thumbs up\" style=\"vertical-align:middle\"> eahm reviewed FreeFileSync:</p>\n\tOne of the best, if not THE best.

FreefileSync was able to compare hundreds of thousands of files (NAS-&gt;NAS) in 10 minutes, which was taking the competitor's product over 3 hours. I ended up deleting the competitor's product and relying on FreeFileSync. Awesome, awesome backup program.</div>\n\n</div>\n<!-- hide area on init so that it is shown by default if user has java script disabled! -->\n<script>toggle('additional-reviews');</script>\n\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t</section>\n\t\t<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n\t\t\n\t\t<footer>\n\t\t\t<div style=\"float:left\">\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/privacy.php\">Privacy Policy</a>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div style=\"float:right\">\n\t\t\t\tCopyright (C) 2017 Zenju:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<script>\n\t\t\t\t\tdocument.write(\n\t\t\t\t\t'<'+'a'+' '+'h'+'r'+'e'+'f'+'='+\"'\"+'m'+'a'+'i'+'l'+'t'+'o'+'&'+'#'+'5'+'8'+';'+'&'+'#'+'1'+'2'+'2'+\n\t\t\t\t\t';'+'&'+'#'+'1'+'0'+'1'+';'+'&'+'#'+'1'+'1'+'0'+';'+'&'+'#'+'1'+'0'+'6'+';'+'&'+'#'+'3'+'7'+';'+'7'+\n\t\t\t\t\t'5'+'&'+'#'+'6'+'4'+';'+'f'+'r'+'&'+'#'+'1'+'0'+'1'+';'+'%'+'6'+'&'+'#'+'5'+'3'+';'+'f'+'i'+'l'+'e'+\n\t\t\t\t\t's'+'y'+'n'+'%'+'6'+'3'+'&'+'#'+'4'+'6'+';'+'o'+'&'+'#'+'3'+'7'+';'+'7'+'2'+'g'+\"'\"+'>'+'z'+'e'+'n'+\n\t\t\t\t\t'j'+'u'+'&'+'#'+'6'+'4'+';'+'&'+'#'+'1'+'0'+'2'+';'+'r'+'e'+'&'+'#'+'1'+'0'+'1'+';'+'f'+'i'+'&'+'#'+\n\t\t\t\t\t'1'+'0'+'8'+';'+'e'+'s'+'y'+'&'+'#'+'1'+'1'+'0'+';'+'c'+'&'+'#'+'4'+'6'+';'+'o'+'r'+'&'+'#'+'1'+'0'+\n\t\t\t\t\t'3'+';'+'<'+'/'+'a'+'>');\n\t\t\t\t</script><a href=\"mailto:zenj%75@fre%65filesyn%63.o%72g\">zenju@freefilesync.org</a>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<br>\n\t\t</footer>\n\t</div>\n\t\n\t<!-- place before the closing </body> tag:  -->\n\t<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"lightbox/lightbox-plus-jquery.min.js\"></script>\n\t<script>lightbox.option({ 'fadeDuration': 200, 'resizeDuration': 300 })</script>\n\n\n<div id=\"lightboxOverlay\" class=\"lightboxOverlay\" style=\"display: none;\"></div><div id=\"lightbox\" class=\"lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"><div class=\"lb-outerContainer\"><div class=\"lb-container\"><img class=\"lb-image\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\"><div class=\"lb-nav\"><a class=\"lb-prev\" href=\"\"></a><a class=\"lb-next\" href=\"\"></a></div><div class=\"lb-loader\"><a class=\"lb-cancel\"></a></div></div></div><div class=\"lb-dataContainer\"><div class=\"lb-data\"><div class=\"lb-details\"><span class=\"lb-caption\"></span><span class=\"lb-number\"></span></div><div class=\"lb-closeContainer\"><a class=\"lb-close\"></a></div></div></div></div></body>"}
