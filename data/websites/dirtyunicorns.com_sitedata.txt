We started to think and we came up with a decent plan.</p>\n<p>Given that Shreesha Murthy is a popular maintainer with a huge following for his work on devices like the OnePlus 2 and Oneplus 3/3T, we decided to use him as the target for our prank. We figured more people falling for this, the better! </p>\n<p>Our plan was simple. We started to find little things that supposedly bothered us and got on to him about it the week of the prank. This started on 27th of April. We were telling him to check JIRA for bug reports, to fix commits in gerrit and just minor things. One after another, we were riding his ass. He was losing his shit but we were doing this to build things up so when we did pretend to kick him out, it wouldn’t seem to sudden and he would sell it. About 2 days in we started to feel bad for the guy. Shreesha is a young guy (probably the youngest in DU) and we didn’t this to cause him any issues in real life. </p>\n<p>Anyways, we brought in on the prank. We told him all about it, he laughed and we told him not to say anything. He was now in on it. We kept on ‘riding’ him and even team members were like ‘OH SHIT’. Anyways, 2 days ago we “kicked him out”. We booted him from our chats (slack, telegram, etc). We removed his repos BUT not before forking them first. THEN we made an announcement saying that we did just that. We said that we wouldn’t go into detail but that we parted ways with Shreesha. It was epic! We (Shreesha, Josh, Bret, Edwin, Nick and I were all laughing). </p>\n<p>It wasn’t enough tho. Some people were still calling bullshit and that it was part of a early April fools prank. We denied it of course but they still said ‘eh, we’ll wait til April 2nd before we believe anything’.</p>\n<p>That’s when we knew we had to step shit up!</p>\n<p>I got on Google and found a broken picture of a OnePlus 3T, quickly edited it and said ‘Oh noooo I broke my phone’. This was the dummy and ever so obvious April fools prank. This was done to distract from the Shreesha prank. A lot of people laughed but said ‘Good one but not as good as last year’s prank’. Once that was said, I knew it. They assumed that was the prank BUT we still had the Shreesha prank in play. We didn’t want to just leave it there and so Shreesha and I hopped on Telegram.</p>\n<p>We went into the most public chat we could think of. A public chat filled with over 700 members from around the Android community. Developers, themers and a shit ton of n00bs populate this chat. We jumped on there and we started to argue. I acted like I was mad about Shreesha’s tweet he made after he supposedly got kicked out. Oh YEAH…….I had him make that tweet to possibly draw some people to the prank but it failed, only a few people saw it. None the less, I was supposedly ‘mad’ and ‘butt hurt’ about this in the Telegram group hahaha</p>\n<p>We went at it! He said things, I said things and we had people convinced that this was a legit thing. That Shreesha and I were mad at each other and that I was some what butt hurt about this tweet. We made it so big that even some of the moderators got involved and told us to take it to PM and even the n00bs came out to take part in the drama.</p>\n<p>BUT that wasn’t enough. We needed to convince some folks on G+ who had said that this was obviously a April fool’s prank. So we said OK, lets do the same thing! Shreesha was set to make a post and sell this! He was suppose to come off upset about me supposedly deleting repos. He sold it! People were buying it. I jumped on there and again, I acted like I was mad! I acted like I was stomping my feet and I was supposedly legit mad hahahaa couldn’t be further from the truth. I actually had to stop once just to catch my breath again. I was laughing so hard!</p>\n<p>Anyways, I was supposedly upset and butt hurt and everything hahaha people were buying it! Aside from some people taking it WAY TOO FAR and pretty much embarrassing themselves with foolish comments, we sold it! People no longer believed this was a April fool’s joke! They started to take sides and saw this as a real life beef! hahahaha we were all laughing HARD!</p>\n<p>Telegram blew up as well and people were like ‘Yo Alex, you should take this private’ and nobody was questioning it anymore! So yeah……APRIL FOOLS!!!! hahahaha</p>\n<p>Shreesha is very much loved in DU. He’s a good maintainer and part of the team and will continue to be a part for a long time!

They already got a developer preview and is scheduled for late August or early September. We’re ready and have a lot of neat ideas to expand certain features and create a few new ones. We won’t jump the gun on our plans for features just yet because until we get a change to evaluate the source, is just hot air. Google is Google and what that means these days is that Google might throw a curve ball at us and plans might change. </p>\n<p>Our first impression of Android O has been positive. Very little things annoy us with Android O. Our developers like it and think we can do wonderful things with it. We’re excited.</p>\n<p></p><center>For more information on Android O we suggest you take a look at these two articles<p></p>\n<blockquote data-secret=\"VLoLGscY5d\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" style=\"display: none;\"><p><a href=\"https://yourtechexplained.com/2017/03/21/android-o-announced-developer-betas-to-start-soon/\">Android O announced, developer previews available today</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" src=\"https://yourtechexplained.com/2017/03/21/android-o-announced-developer-betas-to-start-soon/embed/#?secret=VLoLGscY5d\" data-secret=\"VLoLGscY5d\" width=\"500\" height=\"515\" title=\"“Android O announced, developer previews available today” — YourTechExplained\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<blockquote data-secret=\"JCcsVUQBF9\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" style=\"display: none;\"><p><a href=\"https://yourtechexplained.com/2017/03/22/hands-android-o/\">Hands-on with Android O</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" src=\"https://yourtechexplained.com/2017/03/22/hands-android-o/embed/#?secret=JCcsVUQBF9\" data-secret=\"JCcsVUQBF9\" width=\"500\" height=\"402\" title=\"“Hands-on with Android O” — YourTechExplained\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe> </p>\n<p></p></center><p></p>\n<p>BUT hold on!! Android N is no chopped liver. Android N has been great to us and has enabled us to learn a lot and in turn we’ve been able to create and include a lot of different modifications to our project. We also didn’t bring in a whole lot from Marshmallow so things even out. Some of our users would of wanted us to do so but we didn’t and life goes on. We did so because we felt like it was necessary, let us explain.</p>\n<p>While newcomers to the Android scene may think that the point of our project or any Android based project for that matter is to add in as many features as possible, we disagree. That’s not to say we haven’t put on that hat before. We probably had the most modifications in a custom ROM in kitkat. It was fun, not going to lie but it also came at the expense of stability.</p>\n<p>We want stability, great battery life similar to the stock ROM (what you see on Nexus/Pixel devices) and useful additions that we the developers and users of the project would use on a daily basics. I think in Marshmallow we had a perfect blend of all 3. In Android N we continued that perfect blend and maybe a bit naive to think but we feel like we can reproduce that in Android O as well. So to our critics, we’re doing it because we want a better experience than what Google or any OEM provide not compete in a ‘who can add as many mods in a ROM before it blows up’ race.</p>\n<p>Moving on, I recently put out a call to all our users to show us their screenshots. We wanted to see what users were using on their devices as far as features and how they configured things within the ROM. We focused on things like the navbar, quick settings and even the actual settings layout. What we learned from our #MyDirtyUnicorns experiment over at Google plus is that while a lot of users love the eye candy features when introduced, they don’t actually use them in their daily setups. I know is disappointing but is true.</p>\n<p>For example in Marshmallow we had a feature called ‘Gestures anywhere’ that was originally created by <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/113557868342566349490\">Clark Scheff</a> in kitkat and a lot of users found it to be awesome. They requested it and we delivered. The feature works by going into the feature menu, adding in all your gestures and mapping them to an application or action and from there on you could perform the gesture on any screen and your app would launch or whatever action you picked previously would take off. When it was showcased it was a mad house! Users went crazy over it! They loved that it was something they’ve never seen before but when it came down to it, they didn’t use it. </p>\n<p>Not once did anyone showcase it in their screenshots or talked about it on any threads or even our G+ community. I recall seeing a bug with it on the Nexus 7 (flo) and asking Josh if anyone had reported this bug and he replied that he didn’t see any reports. That tells you how much the feature was being used. I still asked around to close friends and people from around the community and they didn’t use it either. Some said it was neat but too much of a gimmick for them to use. This mod alone was close to 1000 lines after it was set and done with fixes and this and that. To us it was a waste of time to bring that over to Android N because it could of potentially caused issues merging in security updates and even major updates. There were many mods like this in Marshmallow and even more in Android N that will not be ported over to Android O.</p>\n<p>We don’t want to collect features. We’re not in that race. We want to expand on Android in an effort to create the perfect OS (in our opinion) for us. I think every project should have this goal but as they say, different strokes for different folks. So in Android O expect for us to change things up. We’ll most likely remove some current modifications but that is not to say that new ones won’t be created or ported over. Right now only thing that is certain is that a few modifications will not be catching the bus to Android O-ville.</p>\n<p>What mods? We’re still evaluating and having discussions about what the final list will look like. We’ll keep folks posted over in our G+ community.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://test.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lol.jpg\"><img src=\"http://test.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lol.jpg\" alt=\"lol\" width=\"700\" height=\"420\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-790\" srcset=\"https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lol.jpg 700w, https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lol-300x180.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"></a></p>\n<p>On the other side of Android N we learned a lot! We’re moving up the ladder, gaining more experience and learning from our mistakes. The last part is the most important one for us because we’re going to make mistakes. We’re not perfect but we do need to learn from our mistakes. <em>If you don’t learn from your mistakes then you’re doomed to repeat them.</em> That saying doesn’t just make for a nice office poster but is true. Our team continues to learn, evolve, share knowledge with one another and we’re excited for what the future brings.</p>\n<p>One of the highlights of Android N has been (at least for me) when the folks over at <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/+221Pixels\">221 Pixels</a> redesigned our app icons. They gave them a fresh professional look and it created consistently across the project. It made everything around it just that much better. The icons actually look like they belong. They’re not too flashy but not too dull and that’s exactly what we wanted. We’re an extension of Android not a replacement. We love the stock look and feel.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://test.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/xcDA57f-1.png\"><img src=\"http://test.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/xcDA57f-1.png\" alt=\"xcDA57f\" width=\"2180\" height=\"204\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-776\" srcset=\"https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/xcDA57f-1.png 2180w, https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/xcDA57f-1-300x28.png 300w, https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/xcDA57f-1-768x72.png 768w, https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/xcDA57f-1-1024x96.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2180px) 100vw, 2180px\"></a></p>\n<p>Going forward with the professional look, we want our boot animation and default wallpaper to correspond to the icons above. We also want to get the community involved so we’re going to set this off in the form of a contest. </p>\n<p>Contest details for what we’re looking for, prizes and all are not set in stone. Stay tuned for that as they’ll be made in a another post.</p>\n<p>In Android N we made a lot of moves. One of those was with Substratum. We ventured off in the unknown of Substratum and it worked out great for us. A widely criticized move to leave the CMTE for Substratum, turned out to be the best thing for us in both usability and perfect alignment with our goals. We wanted to decrease our work load when it came to mergers and with Substratum we can do just that. Substratum requires very little commits on the ROM side and does the same job (and more) that the CMTE was doing for us in Marshmallow. </p>\n<p>OMS introduced by Sony has a strong possibility of being merged into AOSP and if that’s true then there’s no denying that this was the best move and that is here to stay. Expect Substratum to be our theme option in Android O.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://test.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/substratum.png\"><img src=\"http://test.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/substratum.png\" alt=\"substratum\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-792\" srcset=\"https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/substratum.png 300w, https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/substratum-150x150.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\"></a></p>\n<p>In Android N we saw some new devices get added and some old ones dropped. Expect this to be true in Android O. As devices get older, our maintainers lose motivation to keep them due to performance issues and the fact that they want new toys to play with. No list has been generated as of now but a list will come. Stay tuned to our G+ community for more information on that as it gets closer and closer to shut the book on Android N.</p>\n<p>Our way of doing things (AOSP branch and CAF branch) will not change. This is something that has continued to work great for us and we’re strong believers in not fixing what’s not broken!</p>\n<p>We want to thank all our contributors (past and present) and themers for everything! We wouldn’t be where we’re at without you guys. We know a lot of critics make silly jokes about themers but Android wouldn’t be what it is today without these fine folks! They’re a large part of the DU community and we appreciate them! </p>\n<p>We want to also thank all our supporters for everything they do in our community. Answering questions, encouraging other members and spreading the news about our project! Right now we’re under 30K active members in our community and that’s all been word of mouth, so thank you! You guys have been awesome and is really encouraging to see!</p>\n<p><strong>Again, stay tuned for a contest announcement with details and all!</strong></p>\n<p>#StayDirty </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .entry-content -->\n\n\t\t\t<footer class=\"entry-footer\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</footer><!-- .entry-footer -->\n\t\t</div> <!-- .entry-container -->\n\t</div> <!-- .card -->\n</article><!-- #post-## -->\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n<article id=\"post-757\" class=\"post-757 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-announcements\">\n\t\n\t<div class=\"card\">\n\t\t<div class=\"entry-img\">\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<div class=\"entry-container\">\n\t\t\t<header class=\"entry-header\">\n\t\t\t\t<h1 class=\"entry-title\"><a href=\"https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/2017/01/20/options_are_good/\" rel=\"bookmark\">Options are good</a></h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"entry-meta\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"posted-on\"><i class=\"mdi-action-schedule\"></i> <a href=\"https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/2017/01/20/options_are_good/\" rel=\"bookmark\"><time class=\"entry-date published\" datetime=\"2017-01-20T00:29:32+00:00\">January 20, 2017</time><time class=\"updated\" datetime=\"2017-01-20T01:50:12+00:00\">January 20, 2017</time></a></span><span class=\"byline\"> <i class=\"mdi-action-account-circle\"></i> <span class=\"author vcard\"><a class=\"url fn n\" href=\"https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/author/mazda/\">Alex Cruz</a></span></span><span class=\"cat-links\"><i class=\"mdi-file-folder-open\"></i> <a href=\"https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/category/announcements/\" rel=\"category tag\">Announcements</a></span><span class=\"comments-link\"><i class=\"mdi-action-question-answer\"></i> <a href=\"https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/2017/01/20/options_are_good/#disqus_thread\" data-disqus-identifier=\"757 http://test.dirtyunicorns.com/?p=757\">0 Comments</a></span>\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .entry-meta -->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</header><!-- .entry-header -->\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"entry-content\">\n\t\t\t\t<p><a href=\"http://test.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/no-root-du.png\"><img src=\"http://test.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/no-root-du.png\" alt=\"no-root-du\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1442\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-762\" srcset=\"https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/no-root-du.png 2560w, https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/no-root-du-300x169.png 300w, https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/no-root-du-768x433.png 768w, https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/no-root-du-1024x577.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\"></a><br>\nAbout 4 months ago we talked about <a href=\"http://test.dirtyunicorns.com/2016/09/06/supersu-the-fear-and-the-plan/\">SuperSU and the conspiracy</a> that had taken a life of its own in the community. While we still believe that there’s <strong>NOTHING</strong> to worry about with SuperSU, we have gone ahead and changed our mind about one thing. We will no longer ship with root. We can’t stress enough how this change has nothing to do with SuperSU. There’s been no evidence of wrong doing when it comes to Chainfire and SuperSU, this is a fact.</p>\n<p>The majority of the team still loves what Chainfire is doing for the community and we will continue to show our support as SuperSU users. This is not a anti-Chainfire/SuperSU post nor is a pro-phh’s superuser one. Both options in general are good, is like picking red or blue as your favorite color. We believe that removing root creates options for the user. If the user wishes to stay unrooted then they can still enjoy all of what makes DU the ROM it is today. If the user decides to root, they can enjoy even more stuff out there.</p>\n<p>To add on to this, removing root is not making DU any less of a ROM. Currently there’s nothing in DU that requires root. All of our in-house modifications have been coded properly and any modifications that were not, have been reviewed by our developers and if needed were rewritten to follow our level of quality. With that said, it made no sense to force SuperSU on the user or even replace it with another root management app.</p>\n<p>We will go ahead and make this change with DU 11.1 which we anticipate to ship either on February 3rd or that Monday, the 6th. Please be aware that we will only support what we ship with. If you decide to root DU once this change is made and install something like magisk or xposed, you’re on your own.</p>\n<p><strong>–UPDATE–</strong><br>\nThere seems to be some confusion with the last paragraph of this post so please allow us to clear this up. We will not provide support for ‘mods’ like Xposed, Magisk, Viper4Android and anything of that nature. Rooting alone will not disqualify you from support. If you root and have an issue with say SmartBar or a Quick settings tile, we will not hold it against you. We apologize for any confusion. We assumed it was clear but obviously it wasn’t haha</p>\n<p>Thank you and <strong>#StayDirty</strong></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .entry-content -->\n\n\t\t\t<footer class=\"entry-footer\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</footer><!-- .entry-footer -->\n\t\t</div> <!-- .entry-container -->\n\t</div> <!-- .card -->\n</article><!-- #post-## -->\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n<article id=\"post-740\" class=\"post-740 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-announcements\">\n\t\n\t<div class=\"card\">\n\t\t<div class=\"entry-img\">\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<div class=\"entry-container\">\n\t\t\t<header class=\"entry-header\">\n\t\t\t\t<h1 class=\"entry-title\"><a href=\"https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/2016/12/01/theme-decision-2016/\" rel=\"bookmark\">Theme decision 2016</a></h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"entry-meta\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"posted-on\"><i class=\"mdi-action-schedule\"></i> <a href=\"https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/2016/12/01/theme-decision-2016/\" rel=\"bookmark\"><time class=\"entry-date published\" datetime=\"2016-12-01T23:40:28+00:00\">December 1, 2016</time><time class=\"updated\" datetime=\"2016-12-02T00:24:52+00:00\">December 2, 2016</time></a></span><span class=\"byline\"> <i class=\"mdi-action-account-circle\"></i> <span class=\"author vcard\"><a class=\"url fn n\" href=\"https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/author/mazda/\">Alex Cruz</a></span></span><span class=\"cat-links\"><i class=\"mdi-file-folder-open\"></i> <a href=\"https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/category/announcements/\" rel=\"category tag\">Announcements</a></span><span class=\"comments-link\"><i class=\"mdi-action-question-answer\"></i> <a href=\"https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/2016/12/01/theme-decision-2016/#disqus_thread\" data-disqus-identifier=\"740 http://test.dirtyunicorns.com/?p=740\">0 Comments</a></span>\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .entry-meta -->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</header><!-- .entry-header -->\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"entry-content\">\n\t\t\t\t<p><a href=\"http://test.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cmte-sub.png\"><img src=\"http://test.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cmte-sub.png\" alt=\"cmte-sub\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1442\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-751\" srcset=\"https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cmte-sub.png 2560w, https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cmte-sub-300x169.png 300w, https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cmte-sub-768x433.png 768w, https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cmte-sub-1024x577.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\"></a></p>\n<p>It was almost a month ago that we made a <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+DirtyUnicornsOfficial/posts/f9ao7vhxoMM\">post</a> telling you that we were still undecided on which theme engine/outlet we would include in DU and that we would wait and see. A lot of people said what they had to say but we wanted to discuss it as a team, take it slow and just look at the code because really that’s what makes it go round. We wanted to really just think about which one would be a better fit for us not just for this version of Android but for future versions. A project of this size can’t just think 1-2 steps ahead, we need to think 5-10 steps ahead and not really jump but be ready to jump.</p>\n<p>The team discussed it. Many of our developers took a look at the code and really liked what they saw. Sony has done an amazing job with OMS (Overlay Manager Service) and <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/+NicholasChumCDT\">Nicholas Chum</a> has done an equally amazing job with his <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=projekt.substratum&amp;hl=en\">Substratum</a> app.  So it was a easy decision. We picked Substratum because is the smarter play for us right now and likely future cycles as well. </p>\n<p>We still have a soft spot for the CMTE but we don’t make decisions like this based on emotion. We make decisions that are good for the project and its future. Add in the controversy surrounding CM lately and you can see what we see.</p>\n<p>Substratum has a growing theme support. If you haven’t paid attention then you might of missed what I like to call, the themer migration of 2016. What I’m talking about is seeing themers like <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/+TravisHall\">Travis Hall</a>, <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/+ManuelMöllmann\">Manuel Möllmann</a>, <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/+JacekMalinowski\">Jacek Malinowski</a>, and <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/+AndreZimmermannSolidKakadu\">Andre Zimmermann</a> bring their talents over to the Substratum side. Is exciting to see and we hope the migration continues.</p>\n<p>Substratum like the CMTE is fully open sourced. Is very welcoming of improvements, bug fixes and just overall contributions. The DU team is excited for this and we look forward to it! We really can’t say enough nice things about it.

What this means for us is that we’re waiting on Google to release not only the security updates for December but the 7.1.1 source along with nexus kernel source and blobs. </p>\n<p>If all goes as planned then you will see us merge in 7.1 on December 5th onto a different branch. Once that’s merged we will go ahead and begin work on merging in 7.1.1. We’re anticipating everything to go as smooth as butter but if they don’t then that’s why we prepare for the worst and hope for the best. Once 7.1.1 is merged and fully tested with the new kernel source and blobs, we will begin the merge of OMS/Substratum.</p>\n<p>Once all of this is set and done, there’s a strong possibility that you will see a DU11 official release.</p>\n<p><strong>#StayDirty</strong></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .entry-content -->\n\n\t\t\t<footer class=\"entry-footer\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</footer><!-- .entry-footer -->\n\t\t</div> <!-- .entry-container -->\n\t</div> <!-- .card -->\n</article><!-- #post-## -->\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n<article id=\"post-714\" class=\"post-714 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-blog-posts\">\n\t\n\t<div class=\"card\">\n\t\t<div class=\"entry-img\">\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<div class=\"entry-container\">\n\t\t\t<header class=\"entry-header\">\n\t\t\t\t<h1 class=\"entry-title\"><a href=\"https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/2016/09/06/supersu-the-fear-and-the-plan/\" rel=\"bookmark\">SuperSU, the fear and the plan</a></h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"entry-meta\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"posted-on\"><i class=\"mdi-action-schedule\"></i> <a href=\"https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/2016/09/06/supersu-the-fear-and-the-plan/\" rel=\"bookmark\"><time class=\"entry-date published\" datetime=\"2016-09-06T21:09:11+00:00\">September 6, 2016</time><time class=\"updated\" datetime=\"2016-09-06T22:01:54+00:00\">September 6, 2016</time></a></span><span class=\"byline\"> <i class=\"mdi-action-account-circle\"></i> <span class=\"author vcard\"><a class=\"url fn n\" href=\"https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/author/mazda/\">Alex Cruz</a></span></span><span class=\"cat-links\"><i class=\"mdi-file-folder-open\"></i> <a href=\"https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/category/blog-posts/\" rel=\"category tag\">Blog Posts</a></span><span class=\"comments-link\"><i class=\"mdi-action-question-answer\"></i> <a href=\"https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/2016/09/06/supersu-the-fear-and-the-plan/#disqus_thread\" data-disqus-identifier=\"714 http://test.dirtyunicorns.com/?p=714\">0 Comments</a></span>\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .entry-meta -->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</header><!-- .entry-header -->\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"entry-content\">\n\t\t\t\t<p><a href=\"http://test.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/supersu.png\"><img src=\"http://test.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/supersu.png\" alt=\"supersu\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1442\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-721\" srcset=\"https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/supersu.png 2560w, https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/supersu-300x169.png 300w, https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/supersu-768x433.png 768w, https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/supersu-1024x577.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\"></a></p>\n<p>Let me start off by saying that we are grateful for everything that Chainfire has done for the community. From Mobile ODIN to SuperSU to FlashFire, the guy is a beast and has help the Android community more than anyone. That’s a fact. Thank you for everything you’ve done for us Chainfire!</p>\n<p>We started using SuperSU at the beginning of 2014 and it still performs great! Chainfire has even work together with our very own Josh Chasky in getting our Pixel C (dragon) working with SuperSU. We love SuperSU! Back in September of 2015 the news broke out that <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+Chainfire/posts/XJYJFPtS9Qb\">Chainfire was selling SuperSU to a company named CCMT</a>. We like everyone else had questions. Part of it was that was the unknown. We’re humans and is in our nature to get curious about the unknown. Back then we didn’t know much but that Chainfire had sold it to a company own by an individual or group of individuals that supposedly own other root apps and that it was a new company. A lot of rumors started to circulate. Everything from Chinese hackers to the owner of XDA to even Google. It got crazy and stayed crazy for a while but like all things, it died down. The community went back to using SuperSU and that was the end of it, at least until now.</p>\n<p>A week or so ago, this conspiracy surfaced up again. Same demands, same arguments, just different usernames and more people shouting at the computer screen. We won’t take part in the mudslinging but we have to address this issue because Dirty Unicorns is a large AOSP project with many users and we do ship SuperSU with our builds as of right now. So allow me to put out the facts first.</p>\n<p>1. <strong>We trust Chainfire.</strong> He’s a great contributor and developer and the community would not be the same without him.</p>\n<p>2. <strong>CCMT has been pushing out updates for over a year now </strong>so if they were going to steal our soul here, they would of done it already.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=68546242&amp;postcount=32\">http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=68546242&amp;postcount=32</a></p>\n<p>3. Chainfire has taken a look at their work and says that <strong>SuperSU is not collecting data even with the latest update</strong>, 2.78</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=68540945&amp;postcount=30\">http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=68540945&amp;postcount=30</a></p>\n<p>4. There’s been <strong>ZERO reports of anyone falling victim to identity theft that points back to SuperSU</strong>. </p>\n<p></p><center><a href=\"http://test.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/patrick.jpg\"><img src=\"http://test.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/patrick.jpg\" alt=\"patrick\" width=\"500\" height=\"381\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-724\" srcset=\"https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/patrick.jpg 500w, https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/patrick-300x229.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"></a></center><p></p>\n<p></p><center><p></p>\n<h2>Here’s our plan!</h2>\n<p></p></center><p></p>\n<p>We will continue to use SuperSU until there is something to talk about other than rumors and conspiracies. If SuperSU does stop working or there’s an issue that can’t be address by Chainfire or by us, we will move forward and use Koush’s open source alternative, <a href=\"https://github.com/koush/Superuser\">Superuser</a>. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://test.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/screenshot_20160906-034714_1024.png\"><img src=\"http://test.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/screenshot_20160906-034714_1024.png\" alt=\"screenshot_20160906-034714_1024\" width=\"350\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-735\"></a></p>\n<p>Superuser is what we were using back in 2014 when we switched to SuperSU. We’ve gone ahead and tested Superuser with our N builds (no ETA’s) and it performs good. We haven’t noticed any hiccups with any known root apps. I’ve had a few testers take it and try to make it crash or find issues and nothing. </p>\n<p>So to wrap this up, please just know that we are prepared. If something does go wrong we will put this plan into motion but as of right now, we rather not jump to conclusions. Chainfire is a trustworthy developer and this company has been pushing updates for a year now so again, until there’s solid evidence of any wrong doing is business as usual!</p>\n<p><strong>Thank you again for your support!</strong></p>\n<p>#StayDirty </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .entry-content -->\n\n\t\t\t<footer class=\"entry-footer\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</footer><!-- .entry-footer -->\n\t\t</div> <!-- .entry-container -->\n\t</div> <!-- .card -->\n</article><!-- #post-## -->\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n<article id=\"post-691\" class=\"post-691 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-blog-posts\">\n\t\n\t<div class=\"card\">\n\t\t<div class=\"entry-img\">\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<div class=\"entry-container\">\n\t\t\t<header class=\"entry-header\">\n\t\t\t\t<h1 class=\"entry-title\"><a href=\"https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/2016/08/22/what-you-got-on-my-nougat/\" rel=\"bookmark\">What you got on my Nougat?</a></h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"entry-meta\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"posted-on\"><i class=\"mdi-action-schedule\"></i> <a href=\"https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/2016/08/22/what-you-got-on-my-nougat/\" rel=\"bookmark\"><time class=\"entry-date published\" datetime=\"2016-08-22T22:09:25+00:00\">August 22, 2016</time><time class=\"updated\" datetime=\"2016-08-22T22:22:21+00:00\">August 22, 2016</time></a></span><span class=\"byline\"> <i class=\"mdi-action-account-circle\"></i> <span class=\"author vcard\"><a class=\"url fn n\" href=\"https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/author/mazda/\">Alex Cruz</a></span></span><span class=\"cat-links\"><i class=\"mdi-file-folder-open\"></i> <a href=\"https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/category/blog-posts/\" rel=\"category tag\">Blog Posts</a></span><span class=\"comments-link\"><i class=\"mdi-action-question-answer\"></i> <a href=\"https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/2016/08/22/what-you-got-on-my-nougat/#disqus_thread\" data-disqus-identifier=\"691 http://test.dirtyunicorns.com/?p=691\">0 Comments</a></span>\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .entry-meta -->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</header><!-- .entry-header -->\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"entry-content\">\n\t\t\t\t<p><a href=\"http://test.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/maxresdefault-1-1.png\"><img src=\"http://test.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/maxresdefault-1-1.png\" alt=\"maxresdefault-1-1\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1442\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-705\" srcset=\"https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/maxresdefault-1-1.png 2560w, https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/maxresdefault-1-1-300x169.png 300w, https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/maxresdefault-1-1-768x433.png 768w, https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/maxresdefault-1-1-1024x577.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\"></a></p>\n<p>So many of you know that <a href=\"http://techaeris.com/2016/08/22/android-7-nougat-rolling-nexus-devices-starting-today/\">Android N is being rolled out today</a>. I was a bit surprised to see this considering the new Nexus devices have yet to be announced. History told us that this would never happen but it did (where’s that crow at). Google seems to have lost their mind but we’re ready for the cluster ahead.</p>\n<p>The point of this post is to give our users some insight on where we’re at and where we plan to be in the coming months. I’ll start off by saying that is been great working on Android M. We’ve all learned a lot and really enjoyed ourselves along the way. For us we gained new talent and saw “old talent” step up and really it was great seeing people come together on a common goal. We had a lot of pieces, some didn’t work but in the end I think we’re happy where things ended up at. We made some mistakes but we’ve learned from them and hopefully don’t make the same ones twice.</p>\n<p>Right now we’re waiting on security updates to roll out on Monday September 5th (2 weeks from now). Security updates will be merge as soon as we can into our source and we will release v10.6 on Friday September 9th. Version 10.6 will be our final M release. Weeklies will come to a stop Friday September 2nd. DU builds based off Android N will be label DU11.</p>\n<p>While waiting for security updates to drop, we will go ahead and get a manifest for Android N going as soon Google pushes the source to AOSP. Don’t get too excited yet because we won’t be adding anything or releasing anything just yet. We will evaluate the source for about a week and see exactly what we have. We expect the worst out of Google and so we want to see what’s broken first before adding in a ton of things on top of it.</p>\n<p>After we evaluate the source, we will try our best to fix any issues that we may find and really get a solid base. We have a cabinet full of unique features and want to make sure you enjoy them without any hiccups.</p>\n<p>This cycle will catch those that like the kitchen sink ROMs by surprise. We will be focusing on less. People say less is more and that’s becoming more true than you guys can imagine. We’ve started to really see that a lot of mods were just there and that really nobody used them. We came to this conclusion by looking at our community. This doesn’t mean that we’re going for a vanilla look and we’re going to hype up a battery icon and a new wallpaper, that’s not that we mean. What we do mean is that you won’t see a lot of things in DU that are not used by us. Things like ‘gesture anywhere’, ‘app circlebar’ and a few other mods will be a thing of the past. You want to use those mods, don’t bother using DU because you won’t see it in future builds. We will focus on expanding even more on what we have and in turn provide more original work.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you plan on sticking with the CMTE?</strong><br>\nYes, we will go forward with the CMTE minus the CMSDK and everything we’ve done to it so far. Since the start of M, we’ve made significant changes to the CMTE and we’re curious where things lead. The CMTE for us provides a lot of flexibility for not just the user but for developers. Proof of this flexibility can be seen with the work we’ve done so far. Things like our themes tile, headers integration and the ability to continue to make use of features such as instant patching in apps like Arcus without the use of the CMSDK.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://test.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/16-1.png\"><img src=\"http://test.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/16-1.png\" alt=\"16 - 1\" width=\"486\" height=\"864\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-699\" srcset=\"https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/16-1.png 486w, https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/16-1-169x300.png 169w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>Are you guys still going to support the same devices?</strong><br>\nI would love to tell you that we are and that your 3 year old device will keep going strong but that’s very unlikely. I’ve heard whispers from maintainers that they will drop devices because either is becoming too much of a pain to deal with hacks or they just really want to use something newer. As of right now, we can’t say for sure and provide you all with a list. You will for sure see a few devices swap out maintainers. Some maintainers are planning on getting newer devices and other maintainers are picking up those devices left behind. If your device does get drop from official support, don’t be surprised. Maintainers lose interest all the time or the device just gets too old or sometimes life hits and life is really unexpected.</p>\n<p><strong>So when can we expect DU11?</strong><br>\nLike last year we don’t plan taking part in the annual ‘I’m first’ race. We’re not hungry for donations and we don’t have anything to prove. We’ll evaluate our source and very carefully move forward. We’re learning from past mistakes and rather just take our time. We’re constantly innovating and pushing out unique features. Really just pushing the bar, setting the standard and making the community better! Up until now, google has had a rough 8 month window between the time they release the source for the next Android version and the time they announce the next Nexus. For us that’s a long time to make sure we get things right so you won’t see builds from us for a while.</p>\n<p><strong>If anything changes, we will update via our <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/109738128866939227235\">G+ community</a> so please keep an eye on there for teasers and updates!</strong></p>\n<p>#StayDirty</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .entry-content -->\n\n\t\t\t<footer class=\"entry-footer\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</footer><!-- .entry-footer -->\n\t\t</div> <!-- .entry-container -->\n\t</div> <!-- .card -->\n</article><!-- #post-## -->\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n<article id=\"post-652\" class=\"post-652 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-blog-posts\">\n\t\n\t<div class=\"card\">\n\t\t<div class=\"entry-img\">\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<div class=\"entry-container\">\n\t\t\t<header class=\"entry-header\">\n\t\t\t\t<h1 class=\"entry-title\"><a href=\"https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/2016/07/23/wallpaper-you-say/\" rel=\"bookmark\">Wallpaper you say?</a></h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"entry-meta\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"posted-on\"><i class=\"mdi-action-schedule\"></i> <a href=\"https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/2016/07/23/wallpaper-you-say/\" rel=\"bookmark\"><time class=\"entry-date published\" datetime=\"2016-07-23T13:24:03+00:00\">July 23, 2016</time><time class=\"updated\" datetime=\"2016-08-14T21:52:20+00:00\">August 14, 2016</time></a></span><span class=\"byline\"> <i class=\"mdi-action-account-circle\"></i> <span class=\"author vcard\"><a class=\"url fn n\" href=\"https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/author/mazda/\">Alex Cruz</a></span></span><span class=\"cat-links\"><i class=\"mdi-file-folder-open\"></i> <a href=\"https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/category/blog-posts/\" rel=\"category tag\">Blog Posts</a></span><span class=\"comments-link\"><i class=\"mdi-action-question-answer\"></i> <a href=\"https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/2016/07/23/wallpaper-you-say/#disqus_thread\" data-disqus-identifier=\"652 http://test.dirtyunicorns.com/?p=652\">0 Comments</a></span>\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .entry-meta -->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</header><!-- .entry-header -->\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"entry-content\">\n\t\t\t\t<p><a href=\"http://test.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/maxresdefault-1-1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://test.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/maxresdefault-1-1-1024x577.jpg\" alt=\"maxresdefault-1\" width=\"1024\" height=\"577\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-676\" srcset=\"https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/maxresdefault-1-1-1024x577.jpg 1024w, https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/maxresdefault-1-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/maxresdefault-1-1-768x433.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a></p>\n<p>So as many of you now know, we have a <a href=\"https://test.dirtyunicorns.com/2016/07/18/winner-winner-chicken-dinner/\">new logo</a> via a community contest!

It helps me see where we’re at and paint a picture in my head for where we’re going. I do this with the help of good friends on the team so don’t be fooled either, this is not a one man show. <img draggable=\"false\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\"🙂\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/svg/1f642.svg\"></p>\n<p>Just keep in mind that when I started this project, it was just me, a can of red bull, and a used EVO 3D. I didn’t really see this becoming as big as it is right now. Especially not with the gerrit, website, crowdin, tons of features, etc. I really didn’t see any of this happening. I honestly figured it would just be something to pass the time, which maybe would have resulted in getting the attention of AOKP and potentially  maintaining the EVO 3D for them.</p>\n<p>With all that said, I started to look at other areas that need a makeover, a touch up in terms of design. The default wallpaper stands out as something requiring an update. It stands out because it doesn’t stand out, if that makes sense. The default wallpaper created by <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/+JesusPartida\">Jesus Partida</a> (who also created our boot animation in both LP and M), was designed to do just that.

With that said, a gift card might not be a fitting reward for them due to country restrictions and/or they might just want a pizza instead.</p>\n<p>The contest ends in exactly one month from today on Tuesday August 23rd. We will announce the winner that Friday inline with that weeks weekly build!</p>\n<p>If you enter the contest, make sure that you can use PayPal.

It does not have to be in the DU G+ community, just anywhere on G+. When we get ready to select the winner, we will use that hashtag to find the entries.

We created a <a href=\"https://test.dirtyunicorns.com/2016/06/16/fresh-flair-branding/\">blog post</a> explaining why we wanted a new logo, the requirements and even pony up a price of a 25 dollars gift card to the playstore and it was reshared a few 100 times on Google+. We even got our friends over at <a href=\"https://itechtriad.com/2016/06/17/graphic-artists-can-get-noticed-win-prize-designing-next-dirty-unicorns-logo/\">iTechTriad</a> to help us spread the word, thanks <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/+JeffMcIntire\">Jeff</a> and it was a success!</p>\n<p>Many of you answered the call and submitted your artwork for us to judge. We saw a lot of good artwork via <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/explore/NewDULogo\">#NewDUlogo</a> and made us wish we could pick more than one but unfortunately we can only pick one.</p>\n<p>Our requirements for the new logo was simple. We were looking for something clean, original and that still said DU when someone took a look at it. Again, this was a very hard competition to judge and it came real close with people even changing their votes every 5 minutes and lots of talk.</p>\n<p>Anyways, we would like to congratulate the winner <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/+RajathRanganath-aka-rjt-rockx\">Rajath Ranganath</a>!

Over the years, we’ve gone through quite a few different logos and even talked about changing the name. Some logos were original and some quite not. </p>\n<p>Although we feel like our current logo is one of the most recognized logos in the Android custom ROM community; second to only CM’s cid, we feel is time for a reboot. Some fresh flair to branding is always good. Many organizations, companies, groups, etc do it from time to time and I think we’ve reached that point as well.</p>\n<p>Here’s some of the logos we’ve used in the past few years.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://test.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Untitled-1-1.png\"><img src=\"http://test.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Untitled-1-1.png\" alt=\"Untitled-1\" width=\"960\" height=\"279\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-548\" srcset=\"https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Untitled-1-1.png 960w, https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Untitled-1-1-300x87.png 300w, https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Untitled-1-1-768x223.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\"></a></p>\n<p>What we’re looking for in the new logo is something <strong>original, clean and that still says DU</strong> when you look at it. </p>\n<p>By original we mean nothing based off existing work. Nothing that includes copyrighted logos or a mashup of clip art. If you need any more clarification, please contact us in our G+ community and we’ll be more than happy to explain.</p>\n<p>We want it done in the highest quality you can do it in so we can use it for years to come. This logo will be used in our Gerrit, JIRA, G+ community, website, github, our apps, all our XDA threads and any where you see DU. It will be seen by thousands of users and we hope that it will become as recognizable as the one we have now.</p>\n<p>We want something that can be be used with a transparent background. What we developers have learned about logos is that while some logos look great with a certain background, there are certain backgrounds where the logo looks like total crap. If you already know this then that’s great, if you don’t please keep this in mind.</p>\n<p>Please wow us! Seriously, make us say “That’s the one!! That’s it!!”. Bring your best!</p>\n<p><strong>Did I mention this is a contest?</strong><br>\nYes, we want to reward the winner for their work!</p>\n<p>Not only by including their name in the DU About app under credits and XDA threads but also a 25 dollar Google Play gift card!</p>\n<p>If the winner does not use Google play or simply would like to spend the money on pizza, is also payable via paypal.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://test.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screenshot-from-2016-06-15-231459.png\"><img src=\"http://test.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screenshot-from-2016-06-15-231459-1024x509.png\" alt=\"Screenshot from 2016-06-15 23:14:59\" width=\"1024\" height=\"509\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-539\" srcset=\"https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screenshot-from-2016-06-15-231459-1024x509.png 1024w, https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screenshot-from-2016-06-15-231459-300x149.png 300w, https://www.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screenshot-from-2016-06-15-231459-768x382.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a></p>\n<p>The contest will end on July 16, 2016 (one month exactly) and the winner will be announced via our G+ community that following Monday, July 18.</p>\n<p>Once the winner is announced, we will expect a PSD, Ai, vector, etc to be given to us.

You go into Dirty Tweaks and is like you’ve stepped into another theme. You had a dark theme installed but Dirty Tweaks now has a white background and the icons are green while the theme had them set to red. You pull down the quick settings and you see some tiles themed while others are still stock. You ask yourself “what was all the hype about”.</p>\n<p><em>We’ve all been there and it sucks.</em></p>\n<p>Some people hyped up this theme, you go install it and while it looks good in the play store screenshots, that’s not the case for you. It makes the entire experience a bad one. Most themers use CM as a base which makes sense since it is their theme engine but that shouldn’t mean that other ROMs should be left behind. Our money is just as good as CM users, am I right? Things like quick settings tiles, Smartbar, Fling, etc should all be themed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/+BryanOwens\">Bryan Owens</a> of Team Blackout was the first to show DU some theme love and make his theme as pretty as it was in CM for DU. For this I will always be grateful. He started it and a few other themers have followed his footsteps and shown us love. Unfortunately not all themers feel this way and so we STILL have some jank when installing certain themes with DU.</p>\n<p>This is where DU Certified comes into play. Instead of chasing these guys around and begging and this and that, we decided to celebrate what we have! Give these themers that have taken their time to show us love, the recognition they deserve while at the same time, saving our users the hassle of browsing and downloading 100-200 themes. Sure the play store description gives you some of this info BUT not everyone does and sometimes you miss a gem or you buy a theme that advertises support and find out that what they call support is not really support.</p>\n<p>So a few months back we launched DU Certified and it was a success for the most part. Many themers gravitated to it and for that we are grateful. The problem came with updating the app. It was a pain to do so because in order to update the themes, we had to update the actual app. This was bad from the go and I blame myself for poor planning and I take full responsibility for that.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/+AlexCruz/posts/i7WMreHw32P\">https://plus.google.com/u/0/+AlexCruz/posts/i7WMreHw32P</a></p>\n<p>Tomorrow we move on beyond that and get ready to launch a more efficient way of updating our themes from within DU Certified. The user won’t ever have to update the app unless the code itself changes which that’s normal for any app. Improvements are always welcomed but you should not have to update because of the content.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/aOPkPIL.png\" alt=\"http://i.imgur.com/aOPkPIL.png\"></p>\n<p>That said if the app is going to hold any weight, we need to be consistent and not add themes just because we’re cool with said themer. We have to be fair and put any fanboyism aside and just be true to our criteria. So prior to launching, we’ve gone ahead and removed some themes that may have been certified and met our criteria once upon a time but that’s no longer the case. Again, this is not done because we don’t like that themer or his or her work, it just means that we’re being consistent and want to truly give our users what we set out to give them. Please try to understand this if you see your theme is not in there.</p>\n<p>Themers can submit or in the case above, re-submit their themes when they feel they’ve met our criteria and we’re MORE than happy to check it out! If the theme does meet our requirements, we’ll add them ASAP to DU Certified.

This include all tiles, heads up button, task manager, etc</em></p>\n<p>– <em>SmartBar either needs to be left alone or themed. If you have the basic ‘back/home/recents’ themed then you will have to theme the rest. This looks tacky if you do 3 and the rest are stock.</em></p>\n<p>– <em>Keep your theme updated. Once you get certified, that shouldn’t be the end of it. Please continue!</em></p>\n<p><strong>Just fill out the following when you’re ready</strong><br>\n<a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DirtyUnicorns/android_packages_apps_DU-Certified/README/theme.json\">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DirtyUnicorns/android_packages_apps_DU-Certified/README/theme.json</a></p>\n<p></p><center><a href=\"http://test.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screenshot_20160609-125802.png\"><img src=\"http://test.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screenshot_20160609-125802-169x300.png\" alt=\"Screenshot_20160609-125802\" width=\"169\" height=\"300\"></a>   <a href=\"http://test.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screenshot_20160609-125835.png\"><img src=\"http://test.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screenshot_20160609-125835-169x300.png\" alt=\"Screenshot_20160609-125835\" width=\"169\" height=\"300\"></a>   <a href=\"http://test.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screenshot_20160609-125847.png\"><img src=\"http://test.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screenshot_20160609-125847-169x300.png\" alt=\"Screenshot_20160609-125847\" width=\"169\" height=\"300\"></a><p></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://test.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screenshot_20160609-125909.png\"><img src=\"http://test.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screenshot_20160609-125909-169x300.png\" alt=\"Screenshot_20160609-125909\" width=\"169\" height=\"300\"></a>   <a href=\"http://test.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screenshot_20160609-125918.png\"><img src=\"http://test.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screenshot_20160609-125918-169x300.png\" alt=\"Screenshot_20160609-125918\" width=\"169\" height=\"300\"></a>   <a href=\"http://test.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screenshot_20160609-125927.png\"><img src=\"http://test.dirtyunicorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screenshot_20160609-125927-169x300.png\" alt=\"Screenshot_20160609-125927\" width=\"169\" height=\"300\"></a></p></center><p></p>\n<p><strong>Oh and yeah….10.3 is being released tomorrow!!</strong></p>\n<p>So as some of you might of noticed with either gerrit activity or picked up on the hints, tomorrow we will release 10.3 along with the new DU Certified. Official and weeklies will also change some.</p>\n<p>The week of the official build, weeklies will not be compiled. After some discussion, we came to agreement that it doesn’t make sense to do so. We’re just wasting resources because essentially they were both the same, just different names. </p>\n<p>We remind you all that weeklies and official builds are signed with private keys.<br>\n<a href=\"http://test.dirtyunicorns.com/2016/04/03/weeklies-officials-now-signed-private-keys/\">http://test.dirtyunicorns.com/2016/04/03/weeklies-officials-now-signed-private-keys/</a></p>\n<p>If you’re on a test build or another ROM, we advice you do a <strong>FULL WIPE</strong> for a great user experience. If you fail to so, please stay away from JIRA and reporting any issues in our XDA threads. If you’re on a weekly or official build, you can dirty flash but please be advice that if you run into an issue, we will ask you to do a <strong>FULL WIPE</strong> and make an attempt at duplicate said bug prior to reporting it.</p>\n<p>I want to go ahead and thank all translators, themers, contributors and all who support us!
