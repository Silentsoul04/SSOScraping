id=\"AdThrive_Content_1_tablet\" class=\"adthrive-ad adthrive-dynamic adthrive-content\"></div>\n<h3><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">How Each Personality Type Feels About Small Talk</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Some people truly despise small talk and shallow conversations, while other people enjoy the simple chatter. Here is how each personality type most likely feels about small talk.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000;\">INFJ</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">INFJs definitely dislike small talk, and might become frustrated if they are forced to participate in it for too long. Their brains are constantly running through a million thoughts and feelings at once, as well as attempting to read the other persons reactions- this can make small talk almost excruciating sometimes. INFJs prefer to have real, meaningful conversations with people who understand them. Their energy becomes depleted if they have to socialize for too long, this is especially draining if they have to spend time participating in small talk with people who do not ignite their interest in a deeper way. INFJs much prefer to spend their conversational energy discussing real matters, and things that truly spark their soul.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000;\">ENFJ</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">ENFJs certainly prefer long and deep conversations with people over small talk, but they don’t necessarily despise it. They often consider small talk to be a useful way to get to know someone. While someone is speaking about themselves, the ENFJ is skilled at reading their little reactions. ENFJs pick up on peoples emotions, and often read their physical reactions as a way to understand them better. To them small talk is an important step in getting to know someone, before things hit a much deeper level. They also understand that it is a necessary part of life, and you can’t really communicate or get along with people without participating in small talk from time to time.</span></p><div id=\"AdThrive_Content_2_tablet\" class=\"adthrive-ad adthrive-dynamic adthrive-content\"></div>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000;\">INFP</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">INFPs are definitely not fans of small talk, and might become extremely drained by just the idea of it. They dislike conversations that appear shallow, and prefer to jump into meaningful conversations about important topics. INFPs enjoy connecting with people, and they simply do not feel like they can do that if they are simply talking about surface things. They simply do not handle superficial things very well, and to them most small talk is extremely superficial. If an INFP is spending their social energy talking to someone, they want to truly make it count for something. They want someone who sparks their soul and keeps them completely intrigued, learning about who they are as a person.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000;\">ENFP</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">ENFPs generally prefer to live their lives filled with passion and excitement, because of this they aren’t big fans of small talk. ENFPs want to truly connect with people and enjoy having long conversations about something that is truly meaningful. They want to learn about what people are passionate about and what makes them who they are. They will often become bored with too much small talk, and would prefer someone come up with exciting and unique topics for discussion. They are great at holding conversations with people, but will often attempt to steer the topic in a direction that they feel interested in.</span></p><div id=\"AdThrive_Content_3_tablet\" class=\"adthrive-ad adthrive-dynamic adthrive-content\"></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000;\">INTJ</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">INTJs truly dislike small talk, and become quickly drained by meaningless conversations. They would prefer to save their social energy for discussions that truly intrigue them. INTJs can talk about theoretical ideas and various intellectual subjects for long periods of time, but will quickly become exhausted by surface conversations. They are often skilled at understanding how to communicate with people, but will attempt to find ways to end a conversation quickly if someone is boring them for too much. INTJs are simply very private individuals, who prefer spending much of their time alone inside of their own minds. To INTJs people who are long-winded are simply wasting their time, and if they point out things that are obvious they will find them completely foolish. These types of conversations just don’t sit well with INTJs, and will drain them fast.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000;\">ENTJ</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">ENTJs do not mind small talk at all, and often enjoy some relaxing chatter over coffee. After a while though, ENTJs will become drained by too much meaningless conversation. ENTJs truly enjoy theoretical and philosophical discussions, and prefer to dig deeper. They are willing to wait for these types of conversations though, since they understand that not everyone wants to partake in such communication.
