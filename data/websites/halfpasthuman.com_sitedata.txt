</p>\n<p>Slavery alters the mind. For humanity, slavery left us with two  deeply ingrained complexes that have wormed their way into our dna.  The first is the trauma that comes from the 'cleansing' of the planet  prior to the 'reseeding humanity'. That trauma is still with each  human alive today, recognized or not. In out planet's past, shared  with all the planets in this solar system, a devastating war  occurred. This war destroyed a very large planet, creating the  asteroid belt. This war destroyed the planet of Mars. This war scared  earth to the point that perpetual deserts were created from north  africa through the middle east and over to the western half of India.  This war also scarred the north American south west. This war  destroyed vast areas of south America as well. At some point in the  last days of the war, half of the oxygen in our atmosphere was  destroyed or blown away. It is thought now, by some in the woo-woo  community, that weapons were used to create the environment for our  current, frozen poles. Thus the supposition intends that Antarctica  was deliberately frozen as an act of war. </p>\n<p>It, and many other 'natural' features of our planet, are really  the remnants of a great war. Once and forever labeled as the 'War  between the Gods', we live in its shadow all the days of our lives. </p>\n<p>There are tunnel and underground city systems all around earth,  found on every continent, that are tens of thousands of years old.  Some of these have evidence for human habitation of over 4000/four  thousand years. There exists yet today, the potential to travel from  Turkey to Paris without ever leaving the  ancient underground tunnels  and interconnecting passages within dense rock. What, do we suppose,  could have had humans willing to live underground this way? Could it  be the ancient 'war between the gods' spoken of in all the religions  of the planet? Some in great detail....</p>\n<p>A slave species of one side of the 'god wars' would perhaps be  left to fend for itself while the 'master races' contend between  themselves. Many of the slave species would have been scattered by  the activities of the war. Given the situation of uncertainty, as  well as who knows what form of weapons raining down, underground  seems pretty good. In fact, it is still a preferred choice,  as we  see even these days with the power elites and their bunkers. </p>\n<p>In the aftermath of the great war between the gods, one side wins,  however it is but a Pyrrhic victory, and the winners themselves are  driven away from earth. Perhaps driven out of our solar system. As  near as we can ascertain at this time, they left. The 'why' of their  leaving remains, as with much of this, a wad of mystery under a heap  of conjecture wrapped up in the spitball of speculation. </p>\n<p>The second ingrained mental complex of slavery is a 'love for  authority'. In fact, a 'need to have love for authority'. </p>\n<p>That we are an aggressive, violence oriented species requires, if  we are to be effective slaves, a 'switch' that allows for our  control. This 'switch' is an in-built, epigenetic activated, gene  coding for what we term here at hph, 'authority worship'. It will  grasped that if this premise is correct, it accounts for the  universal expression of hierarchical structures of control, aka 'top  down' across all of humanity. It also accounts for the acceptance of  the 'external savior' idea, as well as the promulgation of religions. </p>\n<p>This love for authority is seemingly genetically in-built to  humans. It appears to be there for the explicit purpose that we breed  docility into our domesticated species. It also appears to be both,  waning, and reactive to an epigenetic trigger. Thus it can be turned  off. A number of humans express this genetic need to have 'authority'  in their universe, and a growing number do not. </p>\n<p>Now it is even recognized by the controlled medical establishment  that there is a 'mind control' gene component to our composition. Not  that they recognize their own organizational structure, and mind set  for hierarchical, top-down decision making is exactly an expression  of this gene complex. An interesting development from within the more  free science of Russia is the acknowledgment that the mind control  gene is easily altered by epigenetic factors in our environment. Such  things as consuming cannabis, or too long an exposure to specific  electromagnetic frequencies, or many other factors will simply shut  off or degrade the genetic push in some humans to worship authority. </p>\n<p>That was always a big problem for our creators. We were made  different from previous iterations of our creator's slave species. We  find their bones still, large, non human, different skulls. They were  destroyed to make room for us. We are smaller, not as intelligent (at  least in some ways such as telepathy, et cetera), better able to take  radiation, hard workers and other admirable qualities as slaves. </p>\n<p>However, being humans, we bring that to the table. We are more  aggressive, less controllable than even the last batch of slaves, and  a general pain in the ass to be around. That is not why our creators  left. It is presumed in woo-woo world that those who created us left  either as a result of losing the war, or for some reason not related  to our solar system. </p>\n<p>Our current crop of 'power elites', mostly human, though warped by  too much of the remnant interbreeding with the 'over seers' species  that our creators used as an intermediary to humanity, are besotted  with this tale of what they call the 'progenitors'. Now days, after  centuries of destroying real history and relics of ancient  civilization on earth, the power elites have begun to treasure these  links to 'their' past. They believe themselves to be descendant, more  than the rest of us, from the creator species, and thus they have  come to see the relics as their personal links to greatness, godhood,  and glory. So they now horde them away, reserved only for the eyes of  the blood elites.</p>\n<p>But there is a problem for the power elites....they have a big  fear....what if the creators are coming back? Thus the Vatican is  dumping tens of millions of dollars scammed from charity to the poor  into giant telescopes all around the planet....looking for the  return. One would have thought the church to be  more welcoming, than  afraid, of the return of the messiah. But apparently not, as they are  anxiously scanning distant space for 'someone' coming back in a space  ship. This is, in my opinion, the core source for their dominating,  and continuous, feeling of fear. It drives all their decisions. </p>\n<p>All of humanity was created to be slaves. </p>\n<p>Our species is not alone in that. There are many slave species out  there in the vastness of universe. Even our paranoid power elite will  now admit to trillions of trillions of planets...so you can bet your  ass we have more slave species cousins out there. </p>\n<p>We may well be different, if not unique, in that we are the slaves  abandoned, the strain run wild. Lost to the vagaries of universe by a  whim of universe, we humans are the self modifying genetic wild child  in the galactic garden of created species. We are as universe wished  us to be. Specifically universe arranged to have us isolated, and  left to mature on our own. </p>\n<p>Unique among slave species? Perhaps. </p>\n<p>Extremely rare? Almost certainly. </p>\n<p>Extremely valuable due to our rarity? Also, almost certainly. </p>\n<p>They, the master species, are gone. What remains, are the remains.  Ruins, and all our questions, about humans, universe, our creators,  and what the hell to do next? </p>\n<p>My thought is to say, fuck it! Human we are made, and human shall  we be. </p>\n<p>And we have an attitude! </p>\n<p>So watch out cousins, here comes the wild strain!</p>\n<p><br>\n  <br>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.halfpasthuman.com/#timetalks\">time talks share link</a> use this link to share the time talks...</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"timetalks_storage.html\" target=\"_self\">timetalks from days past...</a> </p>\n<p><iframe id=\"twitter-widget-3\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" class=\"twitter-share-button twitter-share-button-rendered twitter-tweet-button\" title=\"Twitter Tweet Button\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets/tweet_button.5c39137502ea1894df4434ae5ed041c5.en.html#dnt=false&amp;id=twitter-widget-3&amp;lang=en&amp;original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.halfpasthuman.com%2F&amp;size=m&amp;text=HalfPastHuman.com&amp;time=1492867800779&amp;type=share&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.halfpasthuman.com%2F\" style=\"position: static; visibility: visible; width: 60px; height: 20px;\"></iframe>\n  <script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</p>\n<p><iframe id=\"twitter-widget-1\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" class=\"twitter-follow-button twitter-follow-button-rendered\" title=\"Twitter Follow Button\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets/follow_button.5c39137502ea1894df4434ae5ed041c5.en.html#dnt=false&amp;id=twitter-widget-1&amp;lang=en&amp;screen_name=clif_high&amp;show_count=false&amp;show_screen_name=true&amp;size=m&amp;time=1492867800764\" style=\"position: static; visibility: visible; width: 118px; height: 20px;\" data-screen-name=\"clif_high\"></iframe>\n  <script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n  for real time updates to data forecasts! </p><p></p>\n  <h1><a href=\"essay_access.html\">Older essays...</a></h1>\n  <p><a href=\"#welcome\">top</a></p>\n</div>\n  \n  <div class=\"future_headlines\">\n    <h1 align=\"CENTER\"><a id=\"makeadwordsyourbitch\"></a>Dominate Advertising Online! </h1>\n    \n    <h3 align=\"CENTER\">Learn the secret to how I captured 22% conversion rate on Twitter ads!</h3>\n    <h1 align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"dominateadvertising.html\">Click to Dominate YOUR advertisng key words campaign!</a></h1>\n   <p><a href=\"#welcome\">top</a></p>\n\n  </div>\n<div class=\"chemies\">\n \n<h2><a id=\"chemies\"></a>How to Breathe Free in Chemtrail world...</h2>\n<p>Chemtrails are just a symptom!

Some interesting conclusions have come from gnawing on this subject. One very pertinent to our discussion to day: no person will ever be sued such that the subject of chemtrails comes to open court. You see, whomever is in charge has this thing so tightly screwed down, that i, or anyone, can offer all the medical advice they want without being a doctor, even to the point of actually trying to emulate the allopaths, and they will never be sued by officialdom of any form, nor will officialdom allow them to be sued by anyone else! All because it would provide an open court forum for the subject of chemtrails, and even worse and long before the court got involved, there would be DISCOVERY that could be hugely wide....so keep on keeping on helping people get beyond the health impacts of chemtrails as you can be sure that the American Medical Monopoly will not bother you. </p>\n<p>i am not offering medical advice here, i am offering explorations i have undertaken which have aided my health even in the Chemtrail Age!</p>\n<p>All the items referenced have links to my Amazon store so i make a few pennies should you decide to purchase. </p>\n<h2>Those bastard chemies....</h2>\n<p>Chemtrails are composed of metals.

This mixture promotes the lungs at several different levels, but can be harshly received by some body types so start with a small amount out of one capsule, and then build up. Note it will induce coughing and expelling material from the lungs. Do not over use. So just a few days as required by conditions. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://astore.amazon.com/halfpasthuman-20?_encoding=UTF8&amp;node=3\">Ashwaganda</a> is a general tonic used extensively for thousands of years in ayurvedic medicine. Good for brain and lungs, as well as aiding sleep and providing energy. Some effects also in removing metals from the colon.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://astore.amazon.com/halfpasthuman-20?_encoding=UTF8&amp;node=3\">Suma root (extract or powder)</a> used as lung and muscle support. Also provides nerve and blood boosting properties. Another adaptogenic substance like ashwaganda, Suma root is also a good bronchial support with mild dilation properties. It is very very good for expelling material from the lungs. Should NOT be combined with either the black seed oil or the Breathe formula as you will be doubling up on effects creating a harsher response in your system that could be damaging. Suma root combines very well for some body types with Ashwaganda or Ginseng. Note Ginseng is a great tonic, but seems to provide fewer specific benefits over either Suma or Ashwaganda. </p>\n<p>Suma is known to produce long lasting effects in both musculature and core systemic functions. These include gall bladder, liver, and intestinal function. Note that unlike Black Seed Oil below, Suma does not cause biome depletion (won't kill off your good gut bacteria). Suma is also an anti-tumor agent, and provides a host of other benefits, many of which will be beneficial to how your body reacts to chemtrails, especially if over 55. However, as with all supplements or any thing at all for that matter, check with reliable sources for contra indications with your medicines already in your system...not only the ones you are taking. As an example, Suma, and many of the other tonics are known to adjust your blood sugar, and blood pressure. So if taking medicines for those, be advised that tonics in general, and suma root in particular may well make those meds work faster or 'better'. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006SVU0A0?ie=UTF8&amp;creativeASIN=B006SVU0A0&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=halfpasthuman-20\">Black Seed Oil</a> *(episodic, not a daily tonic). Black seed oil should be taken as a teaspoon or more of the oil on the top of a cup of hot liquid such as tea. Coffee is ok to use as well, but note you should not have dairy with your black seed oil as it will bind up many of the oils' good qualities in the milk and they will not be absorbed properly. Black teas seem to work best as carriers of black seed oil as they provide a synergistic effect with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine\">caffeine</a>. Black seed oil is best used for controlling episodes of 'chemie asthma'. Black seed oil is a bronchial dilator and will open and release tensions in the lungs. Black seed oil is also anti-tumor and is a general energy boosting substance. Note to take plenty of probiotics as black seed oil can deplete your gut biome. Black seed oil is THE place to start for assistance with many forms of cancer as well. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Brain:</h2>\n<p> Please note right now that your brain is composed of an emulsified oil (basically), and the metals in chemtrails affect it at the level of its construction and broadly by inhibiting new brain cell construction due to the 'drying' nature of chemtrails. Again please note that i am obviously treating the exposure to chemtrails here in a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) or Ayurvedic manner. The advice derived from this is to increase your fat intake to compensate for the 'shrinkage' effect of the metals. </p>\n<p>The good news, as noted above is that the brain will be helped by the general cleansing of the system and the support of the adaptogens for the lungs. </p>\n<p>Also note that brains are tricky to mess about with so we will not. What we will do is to direct you to several amino acids that may be of interest and let it go at that. These are NOT easy to get, nor easy to mess with, as they require lots of very precise measurements. <strong>So do not pursue these unless you are already into bio-hacking and know why these three need to be taken together and at what proper ratio.</strong></p>\n<p>The following links are to my friend <a href=\"http://www.purebulk.com\">Tim's place called 'Pure Bulk'</a>. It has the best supplements in quality i have ever run across. Check him out, nearly a local boy, being down in OR. </p>\n<p>It is also good to know that cheap supplements, especially those to be used on the brain or as a daily tonic are <strong>not the way to go</strong>. Many cheap supplements are cheap as they offer bad value, having heavy metals or other problems with them. </p>\n<p><strong>PureBulk delivers outstanding value for your money.</strong> i know the guy only on the internet, and have been buying from him myself for years. Never gotten anything less than top quality. Plus i get good advice from Tim and his crew. i am not paid to say this, merely impressed by people going the extra mile without even being asked. Go elsewhere for this kind of stuff, and in my opinion, you will be getting an inferior product. </p>\n<p>Now, note that DMAE bitartrate is the primary brain booster in this mix, but if you are a bio-hacker, and already stacking but not going this route, you need to seriously research for conflicts. Also from an ayurvedic or TCM view point DMAE is a medium level 'bitter', and also provides the benefits of  that taste to your system. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://purebulk.com/dmae-bitartrate-powder/\">DMAE bitartrate</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://purebulk.com/l-carnosine-powder/\">L-Carnosine</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://purebulk.com/alcar-acetyl-l-carnitine-powder/\">L-Carnitine </a></p>\n<h2>Chelation and cleansing:</h2>\n<p>Some substances can be used to draw metals out of the human body by various means. These include such things as organic clays of various types, certain forms of mineralized salts, and others. i am of the opinion that the metals within chemtrails will certainly be removed by these more physical methods, but in general the amount of energy put into these would be better served finding a plant based tonic that suited the body. The <a href=\"http://astore.amazon.com/halfpasthuman-20?_encoding=UTF8&amp;node=3\">tonics</a> will be providing the body with assistance at all levels including cleansing, albeit in a more gentle fashion. </p>\n<h2>Biome</h2>\n<p>Your <a href=\"http://astore.amazon.com/halfpasthuman-20?_encoding=UTF8&amp;node=2\">gut biome</a> is a wonderful ecosystem with millions of members who are working their entire lives in your service. Do not neglect them and they will not neglect your body. Get your gut biome refreshed daily to aid your body in overcoming the effects of exposure to chemtrails. </p>\n<p><img src=\"images/chemies_infographic.jpg\" width=\"701\" height=\"870\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"#welcome\">top</a></p>\n</div>\n\n\n<footer class=\"mainfooter\">\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>copyleft © 2017 <a href=\"index.html\">halfpasthuman.com</a>-  claims for invention and labor on content held herein.\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>What's the difference between those who read my content and </p>\n      <blockquote>\n        <p>those who don't....</p>\n        <blockquote>\n          <p>\tinquiring minds want to know.        </p>\n        </blockquote>\n      </blockquote>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n</footer>\n</div>\n\n<!-- Twitter single-event website tag code -->\n<script src=\"//platform.twitter.com/oct.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-adsbygoogle-status=\"done\" style=\"display: none; width: auto; height: auto;\"><ins id=\"aswift_0_expand\" style=\"display:inline-table;border:none;height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:0px;background-color:transparent\"><ins id=\"aswift_0_anchor\" style=\"display:block;border:none;height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:0px;background-color:transparent\"><iframe width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" vspace=\"0\" hspace=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" onload=\"var i=this.id,s=window.google_iframe_oncopy,H=s&amp;&amp;s.handlers,h=H&amp;&amp;H[i],w=this.contentWindow,d;try{d=w.document}catch(e){}if(h&amp;&amp;d&amp;&amp;(!d.body||!d.body.firstChild)){if(h.call){setTimeout(h,0)}else if(h.match){try{h=s.upd(h,i)}catch(e){}w.location.replace(h)}}\" id=\"aswift_0\" name=\"aswift_0\" style=\"left:0;position:absolute;top:0;\"></iframe></ins></ins></ins>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">twttr.conversion.trackPid('nvft2', { tw_sale_amount: 0, tw_order_quantity: 0 });</script>\n<noscript>\n&lt;img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" style=\"display:none;\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://analytics.twitter.com/i/adsct?txn_id=nvft2&amp;p_id=Twitter&amp;tw_sale_amount=0&amp;tw_order_quantity=0\" /&gt;\n&lt;img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" style=\"display:none;\" alt=\"\" src=\"//t.co/i/adsct?txn_id=nvft2&amp;p_id=Twitter&amp;tw_sale_amount=0&amp;tw_order_quantity=0\" /&gt;\n</noscript>\n<!-- End Twitter single-event website tag code -->\n\n\n</body>"}
