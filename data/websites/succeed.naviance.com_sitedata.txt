Service</h1>\n</div>\n<div class=\"modal-body\">\n    <p>\n        Naviance Inc. maintains the Naviance platform inclusive of Naviance for High Schools, Naviance for Middle Schools, Naviance for Districts, Naviance eDocs, Naviance Course Planner, Naviance Alumni Tracker, Naviance Student, and Naviance Marketplace as well as the PrepMe customized learning and test preparation products and services (collectively, the \"Service\") subject to the terms and conditions described herein. Your use of the Service constitutes an agreement by you to abide by these terms and conditions (the \"Agreement\"). If you have entered into this Agreement on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have the authority to bind that organization to these terms and conditions. The term \"Client\" herein refers to (i) the organization and its officers, directors, agents, and employees or (ii) an individual, in the case of a non-legal entity who are registered to use the Service as a counselor, teacher, admissions officer, or other professional capacity. The term \"User\" herein refers to a student, a student's parent(s) or guardian(s), and/or a person who registers for the Service through an account provided by a Client or who registers for the Service as an individual. If you do not have the necessary authority, or if you do not agree with these terms and conditions, then you may not use the Service.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        <strong>1. Scope.</strong> The Service includes a browser interface and data encryption, transmission, access, and storage (subject to commercially-reasonable limits as may be imposed by Naviance in its sole discretion). Client's and User's registration for, or use of, the Service shall constitute an acceptance to abide by this Agreement including any materials incorporated by reference herein. Client and Users are responsible for their own Internet connection, communications and computer costs.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        <strong>2. Service Fees.</strong> Certain websites or features of the Service are fee-based and may require a fee for access or use. Such fees are subject to the provisions of this Section.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        <strong>2.1 Charges and Payments. </strong>Client will pay all fees or charges to its account in accordance with the billing terms in effect at the time a fee or charge is due and payable. Service fees are non-refundable whether or not Client actively uses the Service. Client may add additional, optional features by request. Naviance reserves the right to change the fees, applicable charges and usage policies and to introduce new charges at any time, upon at least sixty (60) days prior notice to Client; provided, however that such fees shall not become effective for Client for services then in effect on Client's account until the next renewal period for Client's account.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        <strong>2.2 Billing and Renewal.</strong> Naviance charges in advance for use of the Services. Naviance will notify Client of the opportunity to renew the Service approximately thirty (30) days or more prior to the subscription expiration date. Service fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and Client shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties as may be applicable to the Service fees (exclusive of any taxes or similar fees that may be imposed on the net income of Naviance).\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        <strong>2.3 Billing Information. </strong>Client agrees to provide Naviance with complete and accurate billing and contact information. This information includes legal name, street address, e-mail address, and name and telephone number of an authorized billing contact. Client agrees to update this information within thirty (30) days of any change to it.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        <strong>2.4 Non-Payment and Suspension of Service. </strong>Client's account will be considered delinquent if payment in full is not received within sixty (60) days of the date of an invoice. Naviance reserves the right to suspend or terminate this Agreement and Client's and Client's Users' access to the Service if Client's account becomes delinquent. Delinquent invoices are subject to an interest of 1.5% per month on any outstanding balance, or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is less, plus all expenses of collection. Client will continue to be charged during any period of suspension. If Client or Naviance initiates termination of this Agreement, Client will be obligated to pay the balance due on the account computed in accordance with Section 2.1 Charges and Payments. Client agrees that Naviance may charge such unpaid fees to Client's credit card, if applicable, or otherwise bill Client for such unpaid fees. Naviance also reserves the right to impose a separate reconnection fee should Client thereafter again request access to the Service.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        <strong>3. License.</strong> Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Naviance grants Client a non-exclusive, non-transferrable worldwide right to use the Service, solely for Client's own business purposes and for the right to provide Users individual accounts to use the Service. Client shall not, without the prior written approval of Naviance: (i) license, sublicense, sell, resell, transfer, or assign the Service to any third party, (ii) modify or make derivative works based upon the Service; or (iii) commercially exploit the Service in any way. All rights not expressly granted to Client are reserved by Naviance and its licensors. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Client grants to Naviance the non-exclusive, worldwide right to use, copy, store, transmit and display Client and User data hosted on the Service by Naviance (\"Client Data\") in accordance with the terms of the privacy policy referenced in Section 5.1 herein. User acknowledges that User has no rights except as expressly identified in the Privacy Statement with respect to Client Data.\n    </p>\n    <strong>4. Client and User Responsibilities.</strong>\n    <p>\n        <strong>4.1 Client Responsibilities.</strong> Client is responsible for any and all activities (other than User purchases) that occur under Client's and its Users' accounts. Client shall: (i) maintain the confidentiality of Users' names and passwords; (ii) notify Naviance immediately of any unauthorized use of any password or account or any other known or suspected breach of security; (iii) report to Naviance immediately and use reasonable efforts to stop immediately any use of the Service inconsistent with the terms of the License provided in Section 3 herein that is known or suspected by Client; (iv) assure that use of the Service shall at all times comply with all applicable local, state, federal, and international laws, regulations, and conventions, including without limitation those related to data collection, use, disclosure and privacy; international communications; and the exportation of technical or personal data; (v) assure that use of the Service shall at all times conform to the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and (vi) not impersonate another user of the Service or provide false identity information to gain access to or use the Service.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        <strong>4.2 User Responsibilities.</strong> Users are responsible for any and all activities that occur under their accounts. Users shall: (i) maintain the confidentiality of their names and passwords; (ii) notify Client who provides User's access immediately of any unauthorized use of any password or account or any other known or suspected breach of security; (iii) report to Client who provides User's access immediately and use reasonable efforts to stop immediately any use of the Service inconsistent with the terms of the License provided in Section 3 herein that is known or suspected by Users; (iv) use the Service in compliance with all applicable local, state, federal, and international laws, regulations, and conventions, as well as with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and (v) not impersonate another user of the Service or provide false identity information to gain access to or use the Service. User will not attempt to change any fields that are not intended for User modification. Any attempt by User to view or manipulate the records of another User will be deemed a material breach and, in addition to exercising its termination rights under this Agreement, Naviance may, in its discretion, inform any relevant authorities.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        <strong>5. Account Information and Data.</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        <strong>5.1 Privacy. </strong>Naviance is committed to protecting the privacy of Client Data and maintains a detailed privacy policy, which may be viewed at\n        <a href=\"#privacy\" class=\"dark\">http://succeed.naviance.com/auth/signin#privacy</a>\n        Naviance reserves the right to modify its privacy policy in accordance with the procedure outlined in Section 17 herein. Without limiting the generality of Section 4.1(iv) of this Agreement, Client represents that it complies with all applicable data privacy laws, rules and regulations with respect to the personal data it stores, collects, and maintains through the Service.\n    </p>\n    <strong>5.2 Security. </strong>\n    <p>\n        <strong>5.2.1</strong> The Service has security measures in place to help protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the data under Naviance's control. When the Service is accessed using a supported web browser, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology protects information using both server authentication and data encryption to help ensure that data are safe, secure, and available only to authorized users. Naviance also implements an advanced security method based on dynamic data and encoded session identifications, and hosts the Service in a secure server environment that uses a firewall and other advanced technology in an effort to prevent interference or access from outside intruders. Finally, the Service requires unique account identifiers, user names, and passwords that must be entered each time a Client or User signs on. These safeguards help to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of data. The Internet, however, is not perfectly secure and Naviance shall not be responsible for security breaches not reasonably within its control.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        <strong>5.2.2 </strong>Without limiting the generality of Section 4.1(iv) of this Agreement, Client shall comply with all applicable data security laws, regulations and business guidance published by the Federal Trade Commission, and implement, maintain and update (as appropriate) reasonable security policies, procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the personal information collected through the Service, in order to protect such information from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        <strong>5.3 Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\"FERPA\"). </strong>In the event Client is subject to the provisions of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), the Parties agree as follows: (A) Client appoints Naviance as a \"school official\" as that term is used in FERPA Â§Â§99.7(a)(3)(iii) and 99.31(a)(1) and as interpreted by the Family Policy Compliance Office, and determines that Naviance has a \"legitimate educational interest,\" for the purpose of carrying out its responsibilities under the Agreement. (B) Naviance acknowledges that it shall be bound by all relevant provisions of FERPA and agrees that personally identifiable information obtained from Client by Naviance in the performance of this Agreement: (i) will not be disclosed to third parties, except as expressly provided for in FERPA Â§Â§99.31, without signed and dated written consent of the student, or if the student is under eighteen (18) years of age, signed and written consent of the student's parents/guardians and (ii) will be used only to fulfill Naviance's responsibilities under the Agreement. In accordance with FERPA, the Parties agree that any consents to disclose information may be made electronically.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        <strong>5.4 Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (\"COPPA\"). </strong>Without limiting the generality of Section 4.1(iv) of this Agreement, in the event that Client's use of the Service subjects Client to the provisions of COPPA, Client acknowledges that: (i) if it chooses to make Family Connection available to Users that Client shall be considered the \"operator\" of that website for the purposes of COPPA, and (ii) Client shall fully comply with COPPA and any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        <strong>6. Term and Termination.</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        <strong>6.1 Term of Service.</strong> This Agreement commences on the date Client access to the Service is first enabled (\"Effective Date\") and shall continue for an initial term of one year or longer subject to mutual agreement by the Parties, which may be renewed by mutual agreement, unless terminated sooner pursuant to this Agreement. In the event the term is longer than one year as agreed upon and stipulated on the order form and the client desires to cancel this agreement before the end of that term, Client shall remain responsible for 100% of the amount of this agreement.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        <strong>6.2 Termination for Cause. </strong>Any breach of payment obligations or unauthorized use of the Service by Client or User will be deemed a material breach of this Agreement. Naviance, in its sole discretion, may terminate Client's and Users' passwords, account or use of the Service if Client or User breaches or otherwise fails to comply with this Agreement.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        <strong>6.3 Data Retention. </strong>Client agrees and acknowledges that Naviance has no obligation to retain Client Data, and may delete Client Data, more than thirty (30) days after termination. Upon termination of this Agreement, or at the discretion of Client, Client may request in writing that Client Data be deleted, and Naviance shall comply with such written request within thirty (30) days after termination. Naviance has no obligation to retain Client Data if Client or User has materially breached this Agreement and such breach has not been cured within thirty (30) days of notice of such breach. Naviance has no obligation to retain Client Data if the account is delinquent, and such Client Data may be irretrievably deleted. Prior to deletion, Naviance may charge a reasonable fee, for which payment shall be made in advance, to transfer Client Data to Client in a reasonable manner.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        <strong>7. Naviance Ownership.</strong> Naviance alone (and its licensors, where applicable) owns all right, title and interest, including all related copyright, patent, trademark and other proprietary rights (\"Intellectual Property\" rights), in and to the Service and will own any suggestions, ideas, enhancement requests, feedback, and recommendations provided by Client, Users, or any other party relating to the Service. This Agreement is not a sale and does not convey any rights of ownership in or related to the Service or Intellectual Property owned by Naviance to Client or Users. Naviance is a registered trademark, and the Naviance logo and product names associated with the Service are trademarks of Naviance or third parties, and no right or license is granted to use them; provided, however, that Client may link to the homepage of a Naviance website or to the Service from another website for the purposes of directing Users to the website or the Service and that such link may include the Naviance name and relevant product name(s). Client may not frame any page of a Naviance website\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        <strong>8. Third-Party Rights. </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     <strong>8.1 </strong>During use of the Service, Client may enter into correspondence with, purchase goods and/or services from, or participate in promotions of third-parties showing their goods and/or services through the Service. Any such activity, and any terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such activity, is solely between Client and the applicable third-party. Naviance and its licensors shall have no liability, obligation or responsibility for any such correspondence, purchase or promotion between Client and any such third-party. Naviance does not endorse any sites on the Internet that are linked through the Service. Naviance is providing these links to Client only as a matter of convenience. Naviance does not control the third-party sites and in no event shall Naviance or its licensors be responsible for any content, data practices, products, or other materials on or available from such sites.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        <strong>8.2 </strong>Naviance engages the services of third-party intermediaries to provide credit card processing services to Client and Users. Such intermediaries are solely a link in the distribution chain, and are not permitted to store, retain, or use the information provided, except for the sole purpose of credit card processing and as required by law. Before Client and Users submit credit card information, Client and Users shall be required to agree to any applicable third-party intermediaries' terms of service and privacy policies, including provisions on limited warranties and liability.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        <strong>8.3 </strong>In connection with the Services provided by Naviance, Client may register for, purchase, access, or obtain products, services, and/or features to be provided by third parties (e.g., Naviance Marketplace partners).&nbsp;The agreements between Naviance and such third parties may permit Naviance (i) to bill Client for such third party products or services, and/or (ii) deliver such third party products or services to Client. Such third party products or services shall not be considered \"Services\" for the purposes of this Agreement, and the liability of Naviance to Client or any Users for or in connection with any such third party products or services shall be limited to the amount of fees paid to Naviance by such Client or User for such third party products or services less any amounts paid by Naviance to such third party for such third party product or service.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        <strong>9. Representation &amp; Warranties. </strong>Each party represents and warrants that it has the legal power and authority to enter into this Agreement. Naviance represents and warrants that it will provide the Service in a manner consistent with general industry standards reasonably applicable to the provision thereof, and that the Service will perform substantially in accordance with the on-line Naviance help documentation under normal use and circumstances. Client and Users represent and warrant that they have not falsely identified themselves nor provided any false information to gain access to the Service and that they will comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Each party represents and warrants that it shall make commercially-reasonable efforts, including the use of virus-scanning software on computers that upload files to the Service, to prevent the Service from becoming infected with or spreading a computer virus.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        <strong>10. Indemnification.</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        <strong>10.1 </strong>Client shall indemnify and hold Naviance, its licensors and each such party's parent organizations, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, employees, attorneys and agents harmless from and against any and all claims, costs, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including attorneys' fees and costs) arising out of or in connection with: (i) a claim alleging that use of Client Data infringes the Intellectual Property of, or has caused harm to, a third party, or (ii) a claim arising from or alleging breach by Client or Users of this Agreement; provided that Naviance: (a) promptly gives written notice of the claim to Client; (b) gives Client sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim (provided that Client may not settle or defend any claim unless it unconditionally releases Naviance of all liability and such settlement does not affect Naviance's business or the Service); (c) provides to Client all reasonably available information and assistance; and (d) has not compromised or settled such claim without Client's prior written consent.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        <strong>10.2 </strong>Naviance shall indemnify and hold Client and its parent organizations, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, employees, attorneys and agents harmless from and against any and all claims, costs, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including attorneys' fees and costs) arising out of or in connection with: (i) a claim alleging that the Service directly infringes the Intellectual Property of a third party, or (ii) a claim arising from or alleging breach by Naviance of this Agreement; provided that Client: (a) promptly gives written notice of the claim to Naviance; (b) gives Naviance sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim (provided that Naviance may not settle or defend any claim unless it unconditionally releases Client of all liability); (c) provides to Naviance all reasonably available information and assistance; and (d) has not compromised or settled such claim without Naviance's prior written consent. Naviance shall have no indemnification obligation, and Client shall indemnify Naviance pursuant to this Agreement, for claims arising from any alleged infringement related to the combination of the Service with any of Client's or any of Client's licensor's products, service, hardware or business process(es), so long as such use was not authorized or directed by Naviance, such authorization and/or direction having been given in writing.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        <strong>11. Disclaimer of Warranties. </strong>(I) NAVIANCE AND ITS LICENSORS MAKE NO REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, OR GUARANTY AS TO THE RELIABILITY, TIMELINESS, QUALITY, SUITABILITY, AVAILABILITY, ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE SERVICE OR ANY CONTENT; (II) NAVIANCE AND ITS LICENSORS DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT (A) THE USE OF THE SERVICE WILL BE SECURE, TIMELY, UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE OR OPERATE IN COMBINATION WITH ANY OTHER HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, SYSTEM OR DATA, (B) THE SERVICE WILL MEET CLIENT'S REQUIREMENTS OR EXPECTATIONS, (C) ANY STORED DATA WILL BE ACCURATE OR RELIABLE, (D) THE QUALITY OF ANY PRODUCTS, SERVICES, INFORMATION, OR OTHER MATERIAL PURCHASED OR OBTAINED BY CLIENT THROUGH THE SERVICE WILL MEET CLIENT'S REQUIREMENTS OR EXPECTATIONS, (E) ERRORS OR DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED, OR (F) THE SERVICE OR THE SERVER(S) THAT MAKE THE SERVICE AVAILABLE ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS; (III) THE SERVICE AND ALL CONTENT IS PROVIDED TO YOU STRICTLY ON AN \"AS IS\" AND \"AS AVAILABLE\" BASIS; AND (IV) ALL CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS, ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        <strong>12. Internet Delays. </strong>THE SERVICE MAY BE SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS, DELAYS, AND OTHER PROBLEMS INHERENT IN THE USE OF THE INTERNET AND ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS.

Those websites are governed by their own privacy\n        policies, and we encourage Clients and students to read them.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n        <strong>How Clients Can Modify Information:</strong><br>\n        Clients may update or change their institution's information by contacting us, or in some cases, may update\n        their records through the relevant areas of Naviance. We also provide Clients with a dashboard that allows them\n        to access, modify and delete student and parent information, as may be required by law or otherwise deemed\n        necessary from time to time. At their discretion, Clients may also provide students and parents with the ability\n        to access select\n        information.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n        Since Naviance is used at the direction of the Client, parents and eligible students must work directly with\n        their school to access or modify their information or manage permissions.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n        <strong>Security:</strong><br>\n        We are committed to protecting the security, integrity and confidentiality of the data through the use of\n        physical and technical safeguards. Naviance uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption and server\n        authentication technology to protect data when Naviance is accessed using a supported web browser.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n        We host Client data in secure server and cloud-based environments that use a firewall and other\n        industry-standard technology in an effort to prevent interference or access from outside intruders. We also\n        require unique account identifiers, user names, and passwords that must be entered each time Clients, students\n        or parents sign on to Naviance. The Internet, however, is not perfectly secure and Naviance is not responsible\n        for security breaches not reasonably within its control.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n        We require that Clients maintain the confidentiality of their user names and passwords. If Clients become aware\n        of any unauthorized use of an account, loss of their or their students' or parents' account credentials or\n        suspect a security breach, notify us immediately.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n        <strong>Data Retention:</strong><br>\n        As a system of record for its Clients, Naviance retains the data at the sole discretion of Clients, and for as\n        long as they have active agreements for Naviance. After termination of an agreement, Naviance will retain Client\n        data for a limited time period in accordance with the Naviance Data Retention Policy for the convenience of\n        Clients, so that they may retain continuity of their experience should they choose to reengage with Naviance. At\n        the end of the data retention period, we securely delete and destroy personal information from Clients.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n        However, at any time upon termination of an agreement or otherwise at their discretion, Clients may submit a\n        written request to have their personal information provided to Naviance deleted. We will comply with such\n        written requests within (30) days.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n        Subject to prior agreement, Clients may choose to retain their data from users in lower grades for Naviance\n        services for higher grades. The data will always remain under the direct control of the Client and subject to\n        the terms of this Privacy Policy.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n        Note that in the event that a user chooses to submit data to a postsecondary institution, we are unable to\n        delete or otherwise retract that information from the receiving institution.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n        Notwithstanding the above, we do retain aggregated, de-identified data for the purposes described in the section\n        titled, \"How We Use and Disclose Information.\"\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n        <strong>Opt-Out Policy:</strong><br>\n        We send emails to Clients with information about our products that we believe may be of interest. Clients may\n        opt out of receiving email messages from Naviance by contacting us at privacypolicy@hobsons.com or by clicking\n        on the \"unsubscribe\" link found at the bottom of every email that we send.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n        If Clients have opted out of receiving communications from us, we may still send essential communications\n        regarding Naviance to Clients' or students' accounts, such as password change messages.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n        We do not send email messages on behalf of third parties.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n        We do allow Clients to send messages to parents and students through Naviance. Parents and students should\n        contact their school or district if they would like to discuss opting out of those messages.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n        In addition, if a student has opted in to receive emails from a postsecondary institution through features\n        available in Naviance, students must opt out of such emails by contacting the institution directly or by\n        clicking on the \"unsubscribe\" link at the bottom of the email.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n        <strong>Updates to This Policy:</strong><br>\n        As our product evolves, we may make changes to this Privacy Policy. The \"last updated\" note at the top of this\n        page indicates when it was last revised. Material changes to the Privacy Policy will be provided to the business\n        contacts for our Clients, and such changes will be effective when accepted by Clients on behalf of their\n        employees, students and parents and when the Privacy Policy is posted within Naviance. Non-material changes will\n        become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy within Naviance.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n        <strong>Contact:</strong><br>\n        If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:\n    </p>\n    <p style=\"padding-left: 1.5em\">\n        <strong>Naviance, Inc.</strong><br>\n        50 E-Business Way, Suite 300<br>\n        Cincinnati, OH 45241<br>\n        Attn: Privacy Office<br>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        - or -\n    </p>\n    <p style=\"padding-left: 1.5em\">\n        <strong>Email:</strong> privacypolicy@hobsons.com\n    </p>\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\n    <div style=\"text-align: center; width: 100%;\">Copyright Â© 2017, Hobsons Inc.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"forgot-password-content\" class=\"modal fade hidden\">\n<div class=\"modal-header\">\n    <div class=\"row-fluid\">\n        <div class=\"span7 offset1\">\n            <h1 id=\"forgot-password-heading-init\" class=\"bs-heading\">Reset your password</h1>\n            <h1 id=\"forgot-password-heading-success\" class=\"bs-heading hidden\">Success!</h1>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"span4\">\n            <a class=\"icon-cancel-sign-outline fl-r close large\"></a>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"modal-body hugged\">\n    <form class=\"bs-form\" id=\"forgot-password-form\" name=\"form1\" action=\"auth/forgot\" method=\"post\" accept-charset=\"utf-8\">\n        <div class=\"row-fluid\">\n            <div class=\"span10 offset1\">\n                <div id=\"forgot-password-alert\"></div>\n                <div id=\"forgot-password-text\">\n                    <p>No problem!
