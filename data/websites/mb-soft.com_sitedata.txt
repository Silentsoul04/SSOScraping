Science has made a variety of logical errors which cause the poor precision of the value of 'Big G'.  During the past 40 years, more than a dozen very careful experiments have been done to try to determine the precise value of G, but the results have been amazingly poor.  The primary cause for this problem is that all scientists seem to overlook the existence of the Moon in our Earth-Moon gravitational system.  The Earth and Moon form a 'gravitational Barycenter' as sort of a balancing point which the Earth rotates around every day and revolve around every month.  The Barycenter is actually deep inside the Earth, just over a thousand miles deep, about 2902 miles away from the actual center of the Earth, and <b>it is stationary but the body (center) of the Earth rotates around it at around 793 mph due to our daily rotating.  Our Earth also monthly revolves around the Barycenter at \nabout 27 mph due to the Moon's orbiting. These constant movements result in constant gravitational tugs on everything up here on the surface back and forth (several times every day!) A delicate gravitational experiment gets affected, both regarding the STRENGTH of the Gravitational Force Vector and also (slightly) as to the DIRECTION of that Vector pull.  All those careful experiments have never accounted for this Vector Force Addition effect, so the experiments which were done in China or Italy or the United States have given results which have not agreed.  Some advanced mathematics could calculate the precise location of the Barycenter at the moment each earlier experiment had been done, to make the necessary corrections to correct the values of 'Big G' for each experiment.  There seems no doubt that wonderful consistency and precision will then greatly improve the value of the actual Newtonian Gravitational Constant.

The Sun WARMS a small (20-foot or 6-meter diameter), calm pond up to around 85°F or 30°C, using maybe 25 KiloWatts of sunlight power. Some of that warmed water EVAPORATES, which removes around 970 Btu (or 0.28 kiloWatt-hour) of energy per pound (a lot) up out of the water. But then the rising warmed air immediately cools so some of the water vapor condenses out as tiny fog droplets (which are now visible). This now RELEASES a lot of that power (maybe 15 KiloWatts) which had started out as\nSolar heat. Most of that energy now becomes Kinetic Energy of the air above the warm water SPINNING. (Conservation of Energy again.) <b>This is actually how tornadoes form.</b> (I made more than 90 small artificial tornadoes in 2006, 2009 and 2010. If you have had a cup of [hot] coffee in a cool room, you may have seen a wisp of \"wet steam\" form and in a dead calm air room, you may have even seen that slowly rising visible steam start to [naturally] twist by the same Coriolis process!). Then, we use (standard) Ultraviolet lights to IONIZE that spinning air which electrically charges it. This creates a circulating electrical current in the air, somewhat resembling the way circulating ionized iron inside the Earth creates its magnetic field. Many coils of wire are suspended on the inside silo walls surrounding the spinning charged air, which detect the ALTERNATING MAGNETIC FIELDS which pass through the coils of wire (by Faraday's Law). This generates an EMF, or electricity! <b>9 KiloWatts of\nproduced electricity is realistic.

The spinning central vertical axle shaft of that turbine drives a (standard automotive) alternator to create electricity.  Quite cheap to build and relatively indestructible!

I know of at least one!</b>\nThere is apparently an even larger problem than the New Orleans Saints Coaches which exists. In 1998, I spent my usual weeks around Christmas centered on playing Beach Volleyball around Ft. Lauderdale Florida.  We strong players would play from around 10 am to noon, when the College tourist players would start showing up and we had to give up the net.  But I sometimes got my Beach Doubles partner to agree to try to hold the net, against the six College guys who wanted to take over. Those College boys never realized how good we were, but I would get them to agree to the \"formality\" of the sixes team needing to win the Beach from the Twos team. Our team of two players generally could win game after game against\nteams of College sixes. On that particular day, a young boy, a 14-year-old High School sophomore had been watching us. When my Beach Partner finally got bored with playing against weak competition and left, I was left with no partner, even though I still had the Beach, so I asked the kid if he knew how to play.  He played pretty well and the two of us held the beach for another two hours against the College sixes teams.  We only actually stopped because I was getting very hungry and thirsty, but then we talked and I mentioned to him that there was then a restaurant which had a very popular lit night volleyball court, where I went to play each evening.  So he showed up there and we were able to play some more and then talk.  This was to be my last day in Florida before heading back North for the Winter!  But this Sophomore kid described things that scared me worse than anything I had ever heard.  In High School, he was on the Fort Lauderdale Football team, but he was rather little,\naround 140 pounds and so he was made a Defensive Back. But what he told me next was what truly terrified me.  <b>He was asking me if I thought it was \"right\" for the Fort Lauderdale High School Football Coach to have specifically taught him how to hit the star running backs on opposing teams on the side of their knee, in order to destroy the star running back's knee. He asked me whether that was right to do, just to win a football game!</b> To INTENTIONALLY (my emphasis) destroy some kid's life and career as a football player, just because a Coach decided to teach him how to end that kid's career.  Wow!  I was so angry at hearing that that I could hardly talk!  I thought about driving over to the Principal's Office of the High School the next morning and telling him about what I had been told.  But I realized that I was only a stranger, and HIS Football Coach was a CELEBRITY, and there was no chance that the Principal or anyone else would believe what I would say.  Worse, at that time, the\nvery idea of INTENDING to destroy an opponent's career in football would never have had any credibility (until recently with the New Orleans Saints Coaching Staff).  And the kid would have gotten in a LOT of trouble for \"trying to get the Coach in trouble\".  So I did not go to the High School, and simply drove North the next morning.  Only NOW, twelve years later after the New Orleans Saints have gotten into trouble for intentionally destroying opponent's lives and football careers, do I realize that there may easily be an enormous problem.  <b>I guess I hope that some web-surfer might know how to find that kid who told me those scary things, who now should be around 28 years old.  Maybe he would feel safe from any vengeance from that Coach or that High School by now.</b>  But I wonder HOW MANY OTHER kids playing high school football are affected by Coaches who are so frighteningly aberrant?

One day she told me that she had to leave for a few hours, and then she decided to tell me why.  She had a 6-year-old little girl living with us, but she told me that she needed to go to a Birthday Party for her son, who lived in an institution.  She mentioned that it was his 17th birthday.  She clearly saw that I was confused, regarding how a 29-year-old woman could have a 17-year-old son.  That evening, after she had returned, she saw that I was still very confused, so she explained things to me.  She told me that her father had been a significant home builder in LaPorte Indiana, and that when she was seven years old, he started \"using her\" (her phrase) to entertain himself and two of his (male) friends.  So, for the next five years, that horrible man USED his own daughter for sex entertainment\nfor himself and his friends, apparently nearly every day.  <b>AFTER ABOUT FOUR YEARS OF THIS ABUSE, she got pregnant when she was ELEVEN</b> (and she did not even know if the father was her own father or one of those other two men!)  She was so young that the baby, Alexander, was born with many birth defects, which was why he spent his entire life in an Institution.  Once she had told me these things, I was outraged and I wanted to contact the Police about her father's crimes.  She would not allow me to do that, as she felt her father was too important a businessperson in LaPorte that all that would happen would be that she would be humiliated.  I also had not calmly thought through enough to realize that the Statute of Limitations certainly expired for those three perverts.  So, as far as I know, none of them were ever punished in any way.  I wonder how common this is, as I have heard of similar arrangements in other families. A 12-year-old girl in Thornton, Illinois was regularly\nabused by her step-father and several older brothers, for years. She eventually ran away from home and arranged to spend several days Testifying in a County Courthouse about her abuse. But no one seemed to believe \"a kid\" and none of the perverts were ever charged with anything. Of course, the fact that her mother stole many thousands of dollars from the car dealership she worked for in order to hire a very expensive Lawyer to defend them in that Court (from her own daughter) didn't help her to get Justice. <b>IT MUST BE STOPPED!</b> (2010)<br><br>\n<font size=\"+1\"><b><a href=\"public3/warp.html\">Warping of Space - Some Incorrect Assumptions</a></b></font>.

In May 2005, during a visit to the Glen Canyon Dam in northern Arizona, I had a chance to have a scientific conversation with the Chief Engineer for the Dam. I had asked him about the very soft Navajo sandstone rocks to which the Dam was attached, and he told me about hiking out to see large amounts of water seeping through those porous rocks from the high pressure (320 PSI) water deep in the Lake Powell Reservoir. <b>The sandstone was and is washing away by erosion!</b>\nWe both agreed that the Dam was certain to come loose and fall over relatively soon, but he explained that the Politics of the situation was that if he would even mention such concerns, he would have immediately been fired and replaced. So no one will or can do anything to keep an enormous catastrophe from happening, where a 700-foot-tall concrete dam will suddenly fall over and release about a trillion tons of water in the 180-mile-long Lake Powell Reservoir to roar downstream to kill everyone then in the Grand Canyon.

Nope!</b>\nInside your (closed) home in winter, you might have concentrations of 4,000\nppmv (parts per million by volume), ten times greater than the natural air\noutside which is now around 401 ppmv.  (This is commonly measured in\nnorthern homes in winter!)  In old auditoriums which have lousy\nair circulation systems, a three-hour lecture or Sermon to thousands of\npeople can sometimes result in 10,000 ppmv (which all comes from all\nthose people breathing, exhaling carbon dioxide!), which can have the effect\nto make many people a little drowsy! <a href=\"#31\"><sup><b>the auditorium\nnumbers</b></sup></a>  And you wondered why that happened\nto you!  And in submarines, up to 20,000 ppmv of carbon dioxide is\nallowable! Carbon dioxide is actually a very safe chemical, and you\nget it every day in carbonated beverages. The actual main danger is regarding\nthe established fact that the additional carbon dioxide in the atmosphere\nrepresents a \"blanket effect\" to keep heat from escaping the earth.\nNo one actually realized this until about 1960, and we now know this\nmostly from observing the planet Venus, where its atmosphere of\nmuch more carbon dioxide has resulted in a surface temperature of\naround +860°F (+460°C).  That shocked scientists when all the 1960s spacecraft\nto Venus immediately melted! At that time, scientists had never been\nable to measure temperatures there and they thought that all the thick\nclouds would BLOCK the sun from getting through that thick atmosphere\ndown to the ground!  They expected the surface of Venus to be COLD at maybe\n-40°F (which is also -40°C)!  The Earth will never have that much\ncarbon dioxide in our atmosphere, but significant heating is likely.</p><p>\n\nMany Agronomists and Botanists believe that if the average Earth temperature\nrises to just 80°F [27°C] (it is now around 59°F [15°C]),\nthat plants (crops) worldwide will no longer be\ncapable of lifting sufficient water from the soil to keep their\nleaves from drying out and dying.  <b>If all the plants die, then there\nwill be no food for animals or humans.</b>  The fear is that this might\noccur within one or two centuries.  There is a credible possibility\nthat we might have ALREADY set in motion a greater temperature\nincrease than that. Very scary.</p><p>\n\n</p><table><tbody><tr><td bgcolor=\"#ddddff\" id=\"texh\" style=\"font-size: 14px;\">\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar MyTexh = document.getElementById('texh');\n</script>\n\n\nIn general, web-pages tend to be composed by people who consider\nthemselves to be \"EXPERTS\".  It used to be that no one was able\nto get anything published unless a lot of other experts, a Peer Group, also considered them\nto also be experts.  The Internet has changed this, where anyone\nwho has access to a computer can present himself or herself as a\nknowledgeable person.  They often have no greater claim to being\nan \"expert\" than their own opinion of themselves!  They rarely seem to have\nthe appropriate College Degree that might support such a claim, and they are\nrarely considered to be an expert by the thousands of people who DO have\nsuch College Degrees.  In any case, this then seems to inspire the\n\"expert\" to make many ASSUMPTIONS which are not actually based on any\nsolid science or facts or logic, and to express their own PERSONAL OPINIONS\nwhich they then present as being actual facts.<br><br>\n\nThe presentations in this Domain are rather different from that, in\ngenerally being based on universally respected texts, such as the \n<i>Handbook of Chemistry and Physics</i> and <i>Mark's Standard \nHandbook for Mechanical Engineers</i>,\nand the author of these pages received a Degree in Theoretical\nNuclear Physics from the University of Chicago.  You might therefore\nnotice some significant differences in the presentations\nin this Domain.  These presentations tend to drive many visitors\ncrazy by extensive equations and mathematics that support statements\nmade in the text of a presentation.  These presentations also tend\nto include a LOT of the logic and documentation for the statements\nmade.<br><br>\n\n<b>We see this as extremely important</b>, to enable our visitors to recognize\nthe difference between the actual Scientific Method and what is commonly\nclaimed to be science.  Our hope is that some young people might choose\nto pursue careers in science (or Technology) and we want to make sure\nthey can tell the difference, regarding having a productive and\nsuccessful career in a scientific field.<br><br>\n\nStrict science is pretty amazing about how carefully it examines\nfacts and considers assumptions.  It is normal to ASSUME that gravity\nis true, based on what science calls ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE.  All the billions\nof people who have ever lived on Earth have apparently always dealt\nwith gravity!  As far as anyone knows, no one has ever seen gravity\nto disappear!  But THAT is not good enough for strict science!\nIt is still referred to as a THEORY of gravity (or gravitation).\nScience searches for PROOF and, so far, no one has yet found any\nreally compelling PROOF that it MUST exist.  Scientists generally\nthink that such proof will someday be MATHEMATICAL in basis.  Scientists\nare not stupid and we all accept that gravity seems to be really\nreliable, but it will not advance from a Theory to a Law until\nmore strict proof comes around!  This comment is important for a\nthousand other reasons!  You have noticed that people ARGUE over\nwhether Global Warming is occurring.  People seem to think that\nASSUMPTIONS and OPINIONS matter, and the States of Virginia and\nNorth Carolina have governments which are trying to pass laws\nFORBIDDING Global Warming and even forbidding talking about it!\nThat is terrifyingly silly!  It makes me wonder how poorly educated\nthe lawmakers are in those States!  <b>A phenomenon is either true or it\nis not, whether it is of natural cause or due to man-made activities.</b>\nThere are even HUNDREDS of people who have College Degrees in\nscience who are willing to claim whatever some company wants them\nto say, for a few hundred thousand dollars!  Scientists are not\nsupposed to \"sell out\" science, but human nature is what it is.<br><br>\n\nA comment seems necessary here!  Web-surfers are SOOO used to going\nto sites which have FORUMS and DISCUSSION GROUPS that many criticize\nme for not having such features in this Domain.  I don't mean this as\na criticism of visitors, but many of the subjects presented and\ndiscussed in this Domain are REALLY technical!  I would fear that a\nFORUM about many of the subjects might resemble the sort of conversation\nwhich might occur in a Bar regarding Brain Surgery.  MANY people might\nwant to express their PERSONAL OPINION but how many people on those\nbarstools actually have the knowledge or expertise to truly intelligently\ndiscuss Surgery Techniques on the Corpus Collosum?  My question is, just\nhow valuable or productive could such a barroom conversation be?  Now, as\nthis relates to the subjects in this Domain, YES, we ENTHUSIASTICALLY\nENCOURAGE visitors who KNOW how to solve Tensor Integral Calculus equations\nto E-MAIL us with comments and criticisms and questions about related\nsubjects.  Ditto, we WELCOME Theologians to send in E-mails regarding\nany of the Scholar-written articles on religious subjects in this Domain.\nActually, MANY of the IMPROVEMENTS of these 23,000 web-pages are either\nsuggested or inspired by such incoming e-mails!  There are also situations\nwhere us \"eggheads\" have not understood how to DESCRIBE some technical\nor complicated issue in ways that \"normal people\" might be able to follow,\nand so when frustrated visitors have trouble following some obscure\npoint, it is USEFUL for us to get e-mails which tell us to \"chill out\"\nand to \"use English\".  Sometimes, that has been the only way for us to\nrealize that we need to \"simplify or clarify\" some concept.  We REALIZE\nthat we get millions of visitors from EVERY group of people, from some who\nARE on barstools and who want to discuss something on how an automotive\nengine works, to others who ARE working on the consequences of Einstein's\nGeneral Theory of Relativity.  In an impossible task, we have tried to\nmake these presentations have some value to each of our visitors.<br><br>\n\nIn any case, ALL the presentations in this Domain are based on\nthe best science that is known.  Does science \"know every answer?\"\nNo.  But the entire point of all science is to always strive to learn\nmore, to better understand what, when, where, how and why of our world.\nSo, do we YET know every detail regarding Global Warming?  No.  Which is\nactually why I spent several years in collecting all the scientific facts\nand logic related to that subject, in <a href=\"public3/disaster.html\">Global Warming - The Physics of the Process</a>.\nBut there are many of those people who are paid by giant Corporations,\nand others who have terrible science skills, who also claim to tell\nyou truth, when they actually do not.  An interesting example that\nseems to have gotten accepted by everyone these days is regarding the\n(alleged) Global Warming effects of Methane gas (or buried methane\nhydrate).  It would be interesting if such statements were true,\nbut the simplest examination of scientific facts shows that they\nare absolutely untrue!  Yet those untrue claims get repeated nearly\nevery day by Reporters who do not know the science, and so everyone\nbelieves it!  I have collected the science regarding that, specifically\nthe optical absorptivity of methane gas, in <a href=\"public3/disast02.html#methane\">Methane characteristics</a>.  Either an atmospheric gas absorbs important\ncolors of heat radiation or it does not, and laboratory research\nregarding that selective absorptivity identified such effects.\nIt is very puzzling that virtually all scientists and speakers\nattribute such characteristics to Methane gas, where the actual\nscience is very obvious!  So the daily repeated claims that Methane\ngas \"is twenty times worse a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide\"\nappears to be absolutely complete fiction!<br><br>\n\nI want to add a personal grumble here.  Fifty years ago, virtually no one\ncared in the least about the negative impacts of human activities.  Rachel Carson's \n<i>Silent Spring (1962)</i> first began getting people's attention about many dozens\nof the catastrophic things we do to our planet and its environment.\nInterestingly, <b>I happened to be one of the FIRST scientists who gave\ntalks on the First Earth Day on April 22, 1970.</b>  As a First Year Science Teacher\nat a very nearby Thornridge High School, I was recruited to be a Speaker\nthat day.  The First Earth Day was terribly unpublicized and unorganized!\nWhen I got to Dolton Park that day, there was no one who seemed to be in\ncharge, and I wound up choosing a Picnic Table to climb up on to give my\nHigh School Science lesson (twice!)<p>\n\nAllegedly, we now know that we CANNOT be dumping all our sewage and garbage\ninto the oceans, as the oceans are not large enough to safely deal with it,\nand fish and coral and whales and more die off by suffocating after getting caught\nin our plastic garbage.  And, allegedly, we now know that we cannot\nsimply catch fish and animals with industrial methods without exterminating\nmany animals and plants.  Apparently, Americans now catch and kill\nthree times the entire weight of fish of all humans on Earth, every year.\nSo, at least we now seem to be aware of some of the bad things we do.\nMy grumble is that modern humans decide to collect billions of dollars\nin order to finance really small scale demonstrations of some idea\nsomeone came up with to allegedly solve some problem (which WE caused).\nThey form NGOs to do this, so they can get their $80 million personal annual\nearnings as non-profit activities.  I am tempted to think that many of them\nonly initiate the alleged \"saving the world\" projects for the massive\nfree publicity they get and those huge personal non-taxable paychecks\nthey get. (I have the same grumble about many mega-Churches which seem\nto exist for the exact same reasons.)\nEvery once in a while, an actual great idea is come up with.  <b>My grumble\nis that 99% of these incredible expensive experimental projects, which are\nbragged about, were not worth even trying.</b>  The Chinese project\nand even the Solvay Process\nmentioned above are examples.  The CONCEPT is fine, but it is just not\nPRACTICAL, because of a needed scale factor of billions to actual be of value.\nAnother example is Tower Windmills, which is also a wonderful concept\nbut even crude math shows that even if they did not constantly break down,\nno one could afford to build the millions of them that would be necessary\nto actually really solve the problem.  I just want people to THINK THROUGH\nwhether such billion dollar ideas really have any valid possibility\nof solving any problem.  Fuel-Cell powered Hydrogen electric vehicles.\nBattery-powered electric cars. Nano-filter water purification systems.\nEtc. Etc.</p><p>\n\nAn additional side note seems necessary here.  Modern society seems to only\nsee credibility in the comments of any scientist IF he has either\nbecome a multi-millionaire due to aggressive self-promotion and\nspeeches OR if he has gone through the rather interesting process\nof \"publish-or-perish\" in specific publications.  I have always been\na rather low-key person who avoids publicity and self-aggrandizement\nand I also have only once been money-centered!  In 1973 I invented an\nextremely advanced wood-burning stove for my own house, but word got\nout and more than 27,000 people insisted on having one just like it.\nI tried to find some local company which might be interested in\nmanufacturing them but no one was interested.  So I had to learn\na lot about \"business\" and I set up a unique factory where I manufactured\nmy JUCA woodstoves.  Even without actually knowing how to run a\ncompany, and virtually  without ever advertising them, I manufactured\nand sold over $11 million of my woodstoves.  My ex-wife loved that\nprosperity, but I found it to consume my life.  In a later divorce,\na Judge gave nearly everything to her, which was fine.<br><br>\n\nIn any case, the University of Chicago taught me well in theoretical\nPhysics, and my life has included many unique ideas and inventions.\nOnce I knew the things I learned with JUCA, I felt that I COULD HAVE\nrefined about 30 of them into businesses which also would have again\nmade me a millionaire (IF that had any importance to me!)  When the\nInternet arose and I learned of it, I decided to place rather complete\nscientific presentations on many of them so that others might benefit from\nthings I had found and enjoyed, and all without trying to make a dime from\nany of them!  So, in recent decades, the news media has not been flooded\nwith news of my ideas, and I have not again become rich, so leaders\nnow seem to assume that I am unimportant and to be ignored!  Fine,\nbut over the years, hundreds of millions of people have visited and\nread one or more of my web-pages.  I am satisfied with that.<br><br>\n\nI had also not competed in the impressively aggressive University\ncompetition over getting Grants to finance research to support one's\ncareer.  Each student or scientist NEEDS to constantly be Publishing\narticles in specific periodicals to enhance their credibility toward\ngetting such Grants, and it is universally known that even Professors\nwho do not regularly Publish have careers that soon fade and disappear.\nSince I was never into such \"competition\" and even hated the astounding\nFORMAT focus of College Theses, I CHOSE to nearly universally avoid\neven submitting Papers for such publication.  If my typewriter had\nthe \"wrong font text\" or I didn't structure paragraphs in some extremely\nrigid format, my submissions tended to get rejected, even before anyone\nactually READ any of them!  So I lost interest in that, since I did\nnot lust for the Grants that such efforts were all directed toward\nanyway!<br><br>\n\nThe result of this is sort of amusing!  A number of these web-pages\npresented in this Domain include extremely important information,\nwhether it is about generating electricity by unique and advanced methods\nor heating or cooling houses and buildings or other useful things like\nmaking sidewalks and driveways snow- and ice-free, or the Advanced\nPhysics presentations on the faulty Twins Paradox or the unique\nresearch in Nuclear Structure.  The \"established leadership\" has\nno interest in my pages!  Some day they will, maybe around the year\n2030!<br><br>\n\nSo even though many of these pages have been available on the Internet\nfor many years, their advanced Technology and many benefits never seem\nto show up in popular news media.  In a way, that is sort of disappointing.\nDuring the past 15 years, at least 22,000 people have installed my\n\"free, underground air conditioning\" in their homes, while hundreds\nof millions of others still pay thousands of dollars to giant corporations\nfor electricity to run conventional A/C compressors.  It is such a simple\nand OBVIOUS idea (which I invented in 1978 as part of my 100% Solar Heated\nhouse) but still only a tiny fraction of people use it.  My guess is that\nthose few thousand people who no longer have to pay for expensive A/C\nwill tell neighbors and friends, and by 2030, most houses on Earth will\ninclude using my approach to A/C.  I just find it all bemusing!<br><br>\n\nThe result is that some thousands of Automotive students have learned\nabout the Physics of Automotive Engines from my page on that, but millions\nof Auto Mechanics have never learned that stuff!  The same in a variety\nof other fields where Physics is important.  Since I never ask for any\nmoney for any of these pages, there are also many people who assume that\nthe information MUST not have any value, else I would be trying to\n\"get rich\" from selling it!  I find that sort of darkly sad.  Anyone\nvisiting ANY web-page does need to be cautious regarding believing\nsome of the outrageous statements that seem to be everywhere, but this\nDomain has always had extremely strict ideas regarding ACCURACY and TRUTH\nand LOGIC.  But few people seem to accept that!  Oh, well!  The millions\nof visitors to my pages are at least entertained for a moment!<br><br>\n\n</p><hr>\n\nI just said that everything in this Domain is strictly based on brutal\nlogic and known scientific laws and knowledge.  This single little section\nis an exception to those rules!  As a Theoretical Physicist, I want\nto believe that all other Physicists are equally as careful and strict,\nbut there seem to be a few specific subjects where I have doubts\nregarding them having been careful enough!  So here is MY list of\nsubjects (all of which arose within either Nuclear Physics or\nAstro-Physics) where I want to present my IDEA of the ODDS that\neach of these ideas is true and valid.  So this IS SPECULATION on\nmy part!  But I feel this is necessary such that quality Physicists\nin the future might more carefully examine any or all of these subjects.<p>\n\n</p><table width=\"100%\" border=\"2\">\n<tbody><tr><th width=\"15%\">Subject</th><th width=\"15%\">Odds of being valid</th><th width=\"70%\">My reasons why</th></tr>\n<tr><td>Stonehenge Astronomy</td><td>95%</td><td><a href=\"#51\"> <sup><b>comments</b></sup></a></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Pyramids Astronomy</td><td>95%</td><td><a href=\"#52\"> <sup><b>comments</b></sup></a></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Dark Energy</td><td>0%</td><td><a href=\"#53\"> <sup><b>comments</b></sup></a></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Big Bang</td><td>30%</td><td><a href=\"#54\"> <sup><b>comments</b></sup></a></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Black Holes</td><td>5%</td><td><a href=\"#55\"> <sup><b>comments</b></sup></a></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Dark Matter</td><td>2%</td><td><a href=\"#56\"> <sup><b>comments</b></sup></a></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Gravity Waves</td><td>30%</td><td><a href=\"#57\"> <sup><b>comments</b></sup></a></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Universe Expanding</td><td>0%</td><td><a href=\"#58\"> <sup><b>comments</b></sup></a></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Universe of Neutrinos</td><td>0%</td><td><a href=\"#59\"> <sup><b>comments</b></sup></a></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Neutrons within Atomic Nuclei</td><td>5%</td><td><a href=\"#60\"> <sup><b>comments</b></sup></a></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Branes</td><td>0%</td><td><a href=\"#61\"> <sup><b>comments</b></sup></a></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Wormholes</td><td>0%</td><td><a href=\"#62\"> <sup><b>comments</b></sup></a></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Time Travel</td><td>0%</td><td><a href=\"#63\"> <sup><b>comments</b></sup></a></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Twins Paradox</td><td>0%</td><td><a href=\"#64\"> <sup><b>comments</b></sup></a></td></tr>\n<tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>\n<tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>\n<tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>\n<tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<hr>\n\nHere is an interesting example subject. <b>Musical instruments such as the\nacoustic guitar involve many aspects of Physics and resonance,</b> but most\nfeatures of lutes, mandolins, violins and guitars were developed prior to\nmodern scientific knowledge. The shape of the hollow body, its length, width\nand depth, the size and shape and position of the sound hole, the length and\norientation of the fretboard and even the species of wood used and the lacquer\nfinish on it, were all simply incremental individual attempts to try to improve\nprevious instrument sounds and performance. In other words, very little actual\nscience was ever involved in the construction of such instruments. From a\nTheoretical Physicist's perspective, this is all very fascinating, as we\nKNOW all that stuff as basic Physics! Clearly, most\nbuilders of violins found value in using well-seasoned spruce wood for the\nsoundboard, but they made the back usually of well-seasoned maple wood.\nLutes (from ancient times but mostly after about 1400 AD), tend to have\noval sound holes while acoustic guitars tend to have circular sound holes.\nMandolins have a pear-shaped body (which is asymmetric lengthwise), while\nacoustic guitars have bodies that have a wider and narrower section with\na narrower still waist between them. Violins have f-holes for sound holes.\nMandolins tend to have very deep bodies, although the mandolins used\nin American country music tend to be shallow and with relatively flat\nbacks.  It is not clear that very much actual logic or science has ever\nbeen applied in the design or construction of any of these musical\ninstruments! They seem to have all been essentially trial and error efforts,\nsome of which sounded better and some of which sounded worse than previous\ninstruments! You may have noticed that some acoustic guitars are a LOT\nlarger than others. I personally came to be interested in the similarities\nand differences of violins and fiddles. But the fact that acoustic guitar\nbodies seem to have somewhat randomly different patterns regarding the\nproportions of the dimensions of the different parts of their construction,\nseems to imply a certain reliance on experimentation rather than actual\ntheoretical design.<br><br>\n\nAs a Physicist, I also find it fascinating that around 300 years ago,\nStradivarius created violins which are still considered the world's\nfinest, and even now, no one can identify how and why that is! One popular\nGUESS is that Stradivarius changed the chemical composition of the\nshellac he coated his instruments with. Virtually no one seems to\nsee any importance in the fact that he also slightly changed some of\nthe dimensions of his violins from what others have used.<br><br>\n\nMy interest in acoustic guitars is related to the apparent fact that each\nwas built as an experimental modification of previous instruments, where any\nsuccessful new instruments were then carefully copied. We refer to this\nas APPLIED Physics, where an actual deep understanding of WHY something\ncaused an improvement or detriment is considered of minimal importance and\nonly the results (sounds) are actually important. In THEORETICAL Physics,\nwe are usually much more focused on WHY a slight change of some dimension\nhas some noticeable effect on the sound. The size and shape of each portion\nof an acoustic guitar causes resonances and harmonics (along each of the\nthree dimensions). As a Theoretical Physicist, I would study whether the size\nand shape of different parts of the resonant chamber might amplify resonant\nfrequencies which might enhance third-harmonics or fifth-harmonics to produce\nsounds which were more harmonious. To simply build a guitar which had some\nportion which was half an inch wider or narrower, without having any idea of\nwhat that might create, seems rather foolish to me. A Theoretical Physicist\nwould do a LOT of calculations before actually drawing anything up.\nMaybe it would seem important to try having the two halves of the\nsound box to have widths that were in the proportion of 5 to 3, or\n3 to 2, to inspire some desired harmonic in the sound, and also have the\nwaist width in some other resonant fraction dimension.\nBut no one seems to have ever used that approach!<br><br>\n\nTo me personally, I note that all\nacoustic guitars have the rear portion being the widest, and since no one\nseems to know WHY that is the case (which might simply be due to copying\nprevious designs or due to artistic appearance), I wonder about the sound of\nan acoustic guitar which was \"reversed\" where the greater width part\nmight be near the fretboard, or even possibly a THREE lobed acoustic\nguitar (with two waists)! And what about two sound holes???  Of different\nsizes or shapes??? It seems clear to me that if the actual Theoretical\nPhysics behind these matters is not first learned and fully studied, it\nmight take construction of hundreds of three-lobed\nguitars before one was (accidentally) found to have a better sound!<br><br>\n\nThese comments are intended to explain and justify the field of Theoretical\nPhysics! In the real-world, few people seem to care very much regarding\nthe theory and logic behind any existing technology, and a person might\nTRY making a minimal change in an existing car engine or other device or\nproduct to try to\nimprove performance. That is more of an Applied Technology or Applied\nPhysics approach, which tends to be limited to creating INCREMENTAL\nimprovements (such as in the Aeronautics and Aviation field, Automotive\nfields and most others). Modern society tends to rely on such\nincremental improvements. Theoretical Physicists tend to see such approaches\nas being somewhat blind attempts to create advanced concepts and devices,\nwhere we feel that a good understanding of the logic and facts might enable\nan entirely NEW perspective regarding any subject. You may notice this\nrather different approach in some of the presentations in this Domain.<br><br>\n\n<b>Gambling?</b> Here is another Physics thing which HAS affected your life\nbut you never knew!  Any game that uses dice is probably sort of\n\"crooked\" unless REALLY good dice are used!  Only Physicists\nprobably notice that the PITS where the pips (black dots) are made are RECESSED,\nwhich means that some of the WEIGHT of the cube is missing there. Specifically,\nthere is a side which has ONE dot and the OPPOSITE side has SIX dots.  Do you\nsee yet?  The cube is NOT symmetrically balanced!  In fact, because the\nside with the ONE is the heaviest side, that results in the opposite side,\nthe SIX being somewhat lighter and therefore coming up on top slightly\nmore often!  Nearly all dice are what I call cheap dice, and they have\nthis statistical flaw.  In Physics, it is possible to calculate the\nIntegral of the gravitational weight for a die which has rotated\nsufficiently, and there IS a slight preference for SIX over ONE.  Not\na huge difference, but still statistically noticeable if you record\na thousand dice rolls (which, of course, I did when I was a teenager).\nThe fact that dice are often translucent makes it harder to insert a\nchunk of more dense material without it being visible, but REALLY\ngood dice generally have that weight correction inside of each die.\nREALLY good dice need to be designed and then balanced for both\nKinematic and Dynamic Balance, which is rather involved to do!\nIn theory, at Gambling Casinos, they only use the expensive kind of\ndice, but I wonder whether all Casinos are willing to pay ten or twenty\ntimes as much for Statically, Kinematically and Dynamically balanced\ndice.  Somehow I suspect that many Casinos assume that no Guest would\nknow if they had \"crooked dice\" or not.  Mostly since virtually\nno one but a Physicist would know either the problem or how it is\ncorrectly handled in really good dice!  See?  YOU have certainly played\nMonopoly or a hundred other games where your chance of winning or\nlosing was not as fair as you had assumed it was!<br><br>\n\nFor people who might believe or disbelieve any of the information\npresented in this Domain, we encourage having the approach of a Theoretical\nPhysicist at all times, even without any ritzy education.  Check\nANY facts which strike you as questionable. Try to check\nALL assumptions made for the quality of logic involved. As a\nTheoretical Physicist, I am a real fanatic about these matters.\nThe University of Chicago can claim most of the credit for that, by forcing\nme as a Physics student to take an entire 13-week Graduate-School-level\nMath Course which was to either confirm that 1 + 1 = 2 or that it is\nnot correct. Non-Physicists see this as a foolish waste of their\nvaluable time! But we Physicists do not want to take ANYTHING\nfor granted, and want to make sure of even things that seem as\nobvious as 1 + 1 = 2. Farther down in this home page text is the\nstory of that Course, and why I now have great confidence in\n1 + 1 being EXACTLY two! But I became far more alert to hundreds\nof similar assumptions that everyone simply accepts without\nquestion. It contributes toward a VERY cautious approach\nto all fields of interest, and I encourage any and all readers\nto be equally careful regarding whatever they read or see or\nhear, even in this Domain.<p>\n\nI have always been a forever curious person. Little kids are like that,\nwhere they notice something that does not seem to make sense to them,\nand they either ask questions of adults or otherwise try to sleuth it\nout.  I guess I am just a very large kid!  As a recent example, I am\nnow fascinated with WHY we were born with a throat which is used for\nBOTH eating and breathing. Your Pharynx is a short tube in your neck\nwhich carries either food or air. You know how to cause food to\nbe sent down your esophagus to your stomach, while you also know how\nto cause air to be instead sent to and from your trachea and your lungs. \nThe moment you were born, you somehow KNEW \nhow to open and close passages to be able to breathe into and out of \nyour lungs! Ditto about KNOWING how to open and close passageways to \nbe able to get food down into your stomach!  I cannot find any \nevidence that anyone knows WHY we are born like that! Virtually all\nmammals are born the same way.  That seems to imply that there must be\nsome \"survival advantage\" but it is beyond me what that might be!\nYou certainly have occasionally accidentally caused a piece of food\nor a sip of liquid to go down into your lungs, and you have choked\nand coughed for a while to recover from that.

(mid-2008)  This\nhas to do with the economy. <a href=\"#2\"><sup><b>footnote2</b></sup></a><p>\n\n</p><hr>\n\nAn initial observation seems appropriate here.  <b>It seems to me that\nvirtually everything that is sold or promoted or advertised today\nis presented with intentional distortion, bias, spin and sometimes\neven outright lies.</b>  People seem to really believe that companies are\nwilling to create million-dollar commercials and spend hundreds of\nthousands of dollars every time they are aired, just so those companies\ncan GIVE people \"FREE\" carpeting, windows, clothing, millions of\ndollars, etc.  And that those expensive commercials are run every hour to\noffer diamonds that \"are worth double\" or SALES that offer enormous\n(alleged) price reductions.<p>\n\n<b>Doesn't ANYONE realize WHY they went into business in the first place?\nTO MAKE THE GREATEST AMOUNTS OF MONEY THAT THEY CAN!</b>  For the\nrecord, that IS the \"American dream!\"  Should we believe that\nthey are actually really stupid in spending millions of dollars just\nto give even more dollars to us?  Duh?</p><p>\n\nThere seems to be a required suspension of all logic in accepting such\nthings!  Lots of insurance companies (and other companies that pretend to\nbe insurance companies!) tell you every day that you will receive\nMILLIONS of dollars in coverage, while also telling you that you\nwill only have to pay $5 or $50 per month for it?  How come no one\nseems to \"do the math\"?  Fifty dollars per month is $600\nper year, right?  and in your 50 years of adulthood, isn't that a\n$30,000 MAXIMUM that you will pay into it?  Ah, I see!  The company\nis SO WONDERFUL that they are willing to make up for the rest of those\nmillions that you will allegedly eventually receive!  (Yes, I am aware that\ninterest rates and investments will increase your $30,000 paid in\nby some amount, a GOOD increase if they are good at investing.  But\nit AIN'T GONNA ever get to \"millions\" during your lifetime!\nYet, nearly everyone seems to simply accept such TV commercials as\nabsolutely trustworthy and reliable!  And those companies are\nSO generous that they are willing to spend millions every day for the\nair time to let you know about this amazing thing they want to do for you?</p><p>\n\nA little more about the insurance commercials.  Even now, 2016, there are\nHOURLY commercials running that promote this:  A (healthy) 43-year old man\nallegedly pays $27/month for a $500,000 life insurance policy.  Seems to\nme that the math is simple enough where even if he lived to 100, the most\nhe would (allegedly) ever pay in would be $27 * 12 * 57 years or $18,468.\nAnd NOBODY sees anything fishy in that?  An Insurance Company that went into\nbusiness to make profits, and which certainly has Executives which are\npaid big bucks, is willing to commit to paying YOU $500,000 in exchange for\n$18,468 you ever pay them???  Worse, they are willing to pay millions to\nhave slick TV commercials created and then hundreds of thousands more every\nday to pay for the air time to run them.  Obviously, they are trying to\nconvince me that they are SUCH AMAZING HUMAN BEINGS that they would do this\nfor ME, a total stranger!  The commercial goes further and describes an\neven better deal for his (healthy) 37 year old wife, just $13/month for a\n$350,000 policy.  As it happens, I am a fairly smart person, and if\nsomeone offered me a TON OF GOLD for $50, I'd be tempted to wonder if it\nwere REAL gold.  Regarding the Insurance commercials, there ARE some really\ntiny 'fine print' lines that appear for an instant near the end of the\ncommercial, but even reading one word before they disappear is beyond me.</p><p>\n\nAs it happens, I got a PAPER FLIER from one of those Insurance companies.\nIt is not easy, but I can actually READ the fine print in it (with a\nmagnifying glass!)  The reality is not remotely like they promote.  It is\nNOT a \"life insurance\" policy as it is only good for TEN YEAR TERM policies.  I imagine\nthat might be relatively safe for them regarding a healthy 43 year old\nmale.  <b>It also explains that the Premiums increase yearly.</b>  And NO ONE\ncan still get that insurance past age 75.  And the Insurance Company has\nan impressive amount of freedom to raise premiums by their own practices\nand rules.  <b>NOT REMOTELY LIKE what they try to get the 'suckers' to\nbelieve.</b></p><p>\n\nAnd no one seems to think there is the slightest deception involved\nin any of that!  Companies are going around just LOOKING FOR ME so that\nthey can give me FREE cars and piles of money and every other thing\nthat people dream of.  It is no wonder that ADVERTISING is such an\nenormous business!  People BELIEVE nearly everything they are told!</p><p>\n\n(Regarding the HEALTH insurance companies, there actually IS a partial explanation.\nIt is that they KNOW that 95% or 99% of the people who will pay in that\nmoney will never have enormous claims during their lives!  Actually,\nthat probably includes YOU!  So if 100 people each pay in $30,000 in\npremiums, that is three million dollars, which they invest and make extra\nmoney but also are then able to pay the million dollar medical bills\nfor that rare person who amasses such bills.\nBut the insurance companies then make\nenormous profits for their Executives and their investors, and also\npay out enormous medical claims for a VERY small number of people\nwho get AIDS or extreme cancers or other expensively-treated maladies.\nAs I compose this, the US government expects to FORCE insurance\ncompanies to cover everyone and to disregard previously-existing\nillnesses.  It is amazing that no one seems to realize that act\nwill entirely make their profitable game no longer interesting to\nthem that run those giant Corporations!  They will certainly move their\ninvestments and efforts into fields where they can see enormous profits.)</p><p>\n\n<b>It seems to me that virtually NO ONE seems willing to present any product or\nservice or person on WHAT IS ACTUALLY TRUE AND HONEST!</b>  Wow!  It is clear\nthat virtually EVERY company seems to spend massive time and effort in trying\nto find ways to DECEIVE people into paying for their product or\nservice!  Even when they have good quality products!\n(In vehicles, they somehow managed to overlook that Jeep\nCJ5 TV commercial [around 30 years ago] where an eagle-eyed TV viewer\nhappened to notice that a rear wheel had LIFTED OFF THE GROUND in the\nprocess of nearly having a rollover accident [IN A TV COMMERCIAL!],\nand they still managed to get millions of people to buy SUVs, which\nALL have that danger as part of their basic design!)  And Ford and GM\nhad decided that they could get away with selling Pintos and Corvairs,\nwhile knowing that those vehicles of theirs WOULD KILL PEOPLE.  They simply\nset a dollar value on a human life and decided that they could afford\nto settle claims regarding those deaths because they would have made\nso much profit from those vehicles!  And nearly\nevery politician or other public person insists\non \"spinning\" to make themselves \"bigger than life!\"\nI don't know whether we are supposed to conclude from all this\nthat that there are no products or services actually worth buying!\nIt sure seems to be an implication of everything we see.</p><p>\n\nI realize that the reality is that every company is aware that\nmost every one of their competitors do this sort of thing, and they\nrealize that if they did not also do this stuff, they would not be\n\"competitive\" regarding pursuing the billions of dollars\nof profits that they all lust for.  And with only that concept in\ntheir minds, it is sort of understandable that essentially every\nmodern company works hard to do as much deception that they feel\nthey can get away with.  THIS is what modern society has devolved into!</p><p>\n\nHere is another example of massive deception, even though it is for\na basically good cause.  You have seen newscasts which note that\nthe people in Haiti and other countries earn \"less than two\ndollars per day\" which is considered to be below survival\nlevels.  But I bet you have never related that to the (very expensive)\nTV commercials that run constantly that show the faces of very sad\nchildren to try to get you to send in money.  Some Accountant must\nhave calculated that people might not send in money if asked to\nsend in more than $19 per month, so that is what they ask you for.\nTHINK about this!  They even TELL YOU that this would cost you\nLESS THAN A DOLLAR A DAY.  Then they list off the amazingly\nprosperous life that this child would suddenly have due to your\ndollar per day, including schools, food, safe water, clothes and more.\nThey claim that YOU would somehow provide this amazing prosperity for\nthat kid by giving your less than a dollar a day.  Doesn't this\nstrain credibility?  If TWO DOLLARS PER DAY is not considered enough\nto ensure food and health, then how are YOU able to provide these\nthings and much more with far less money?</p><p>\n\nThose organizations which run all those TV commercials NEVER release\nany actual information regarding HOW MANY DONATIONS ARE SENT IN TO THEM\nand HOW MANY CHILDREN ARE THEREBY HELPED.  There is so much deception in\nwhat they do that it is disgusting (even though I WANT to help such\nchildren, I will NOT do it through such organizations.  They neglect\nto mention that around 3/4 of all the money you might send in has\nto be spent in paying to make more TV commercials and then to air them\non thousands of TV stations and cable channels.  They neglect to mention\nthat the Executives of their organization are each paid millions of\ndollars every year!  So the reality is that your 70 cents per day that\nYOU send in barely ever gets to any needy children!  Around 55 cents of\nit gets used up to pay those Executives and to make and air new\ncommercials to get OTHERS to send them money!  In my opinion, that whole\noperation works a lot like an illegal Ponzi Scheme, where constant supplies\nof NEW donors are required to keep their jobs and activities afloat!\nI had realized much of this around 30 years ago, but I was shocked at\nhow extensive the deception was that they do!  There were THREE different\nyoung women I knew who EACH had the SAME PHOTOGRAPH of a very cute child\non their refrigerators, along with the EXACT SAME (alleged) letter from\nthat child.  However, the three supposed children were allegedly in\nDIFFERENT African countries and allegedly had different names!  It also\nstruck me as amazing that a very young child who had never attended\nany school [always emphasized in every commercial] had made a hand-written\nnote IN PERFECT ENGLISH, from each of those (alleged) three countries!)</p><p>\n\nAgain, if there was ANY honesty or truth in the TV commercials, it would\nbe fine.  But clearly at least FIFTY DONORS must have to be sending\nin money every month (money that THEY cannot really afford to be\ngiving) such that an adequate amount might arrive for ONE needy child.\nBut they KNOW that no one is going to be sending them $19 every month\nIF they actually know that they are only one of fifty supporting that\nchild!  The disappointing part is that NO ONE KNOWS how many millions\nof dollars gets sent in to such organizations every year, or whether\nthere is even one child who has materially been benefited in the\nprocess.  Claiming to be a NON-PROFIT organization allows amazing\nsecrecy about such things, and so they have gotten away with that\nrather massive deception for more than 30 years so far.  They  CAN'T\never get into any legal trouble because no one can ever know what\nthey actually do or where the money goes!  Amazing!</p><p>\n\nIn a dark branch of this fact of modern society, I find it essentially\nimpossible to find even a CHURCH web-site which is not chock-full\nof random advertising links.  It turns out that if the site is popular\nregarding traffic, the Church can receive monthly checks larger than\nwhat their Collection Plate provides!  That universal fact seems to\nconfirm that even Churches see FINANCIAL CASH FLOW as more important\nthat principles or morals or the Lessons they try to Teach!\n(Our Church's web-site and also\nthe BELIEVE Religious Information Source web-site that it operates,\nhas NO such display advertising, never has and hopefully never will.)</p><p>\n\n<b>In any case, THIS Domain has the intention and goal of actually\npresenting FACTS, in HONEST WAYS, where NO DECEPTION hopefully\nexists in any of the thousands of contained pages!</b>  Being human,\nI suppose that is probably not absolutely true, but it sure is as\ntrue as I have been capable of trying to make them.</p><p>\n\nThis tends to result in a situation which many people may find\nunexpected!  Nearly every presentation contains BOTH the wonderful\nstrengths of any specific concept or product, but it (hopefully)\nalso contains discussions of the negative shortcomings of those\nsame products or concepts.  The point is NEITHER to \"promote\nor sell\" any particular view NOR to \"rip or denigrate\"\nsuch things, but simply to try to present BOTH sides of important\nareas which you may want or need to someday consider or analyze.\nHopefully, you will find \"about equal\" presentations\non both or all sides of any specific subject, all based on known facts\nand on solid logic, such that YOU can\nthen determine any conclusions that YOU think are most valid.</p><p>\n\nFor example, where virtually any other information source regarding\ntower windmills presents \"immensely optimistic\" comments or claims,\ntoward \"selling\" that concept or some specific product, the\npresentations in this Domain should (hopefully) present HONEST\nand REALISTIC views of what might be achieved with such a system.\n<b>Yes, there IS good reason to examine wind power as a possible\nsource of the energy upon which our societies rely.</b>  But it needs\nto be honest and balanced information for anyone to be able to actually\nmake an informed decision!  There is currently IMMENSE deception to the\npublic regarding the actual performance of the giant windmills and wind farms!\nIt would be GREAT if they could actually do what the public is led to\nassume.  But the fact that there tends to be a ten-year lead time\nbetween contractors being paid to build such things and their eventual\ndaily operation, so the money will be long gone before the public ever\nfully realizes that nearly all of those tower windmills and wind farms\nwill certainly supply only maybe 1/10 of what is now expected of them.\nYou might want to read <b><a href=\"public/wind7.html\">Wind-Powered Electricity for 1000 Homes</a></b>, regarding Practical Large-Scale Wind-Generated Electricity\nfor the facts, the logic and the whole story.</p><p>\n\nLong ago, around 1975, I was amazed that Feature Stories in magazines\nwould be titled \"We heat our entire home with a Ben Franklin\nStove.\"  Technically, that was true, but it was immensely misleading.\nThe story would describe how the family would have to wake up every\ntwo or three hours all night to load more wood in their stove, and\nthen still have to wake up to a 53°F house in the morning, and that the\nhouse was extremely small, just four small rooms,\naround 600 square feet.  THOSE occupants considered it acceptable to\nwake up to a 53°F house!  <b>I wouldn't!</b>  And the living room I am now\nsitting in while composing this text is around half the size of that entire\nhouse!  Maybe I am too spoiled, but I\nexpect to wake up to a house that is around 71°F or 72°F!  (At the\ntime of reading such very popular stories in 1975, I had already been fully\nheating an 11-room, three-story, uninsulated 1896 farmhouse, for the previous\nthree winters, with a very unusual woodstove that I had\nDesigned, Engineered and built for myself, and I would NEVER tolerate having\nto wake up in the middle of the night just to add more wood!  I would also\nnever have been happy to wake up to a house that was not cozy warm at 70°F\nin the morning.  I am <b>NOT</b> a \"morning person!\")\nIn any case, technically, it was not a lie that that family in the magazine\nstory said that they were heating their whole house with a woodstove.\nBut millions of people were later very disappointed to buy such\nFranklin stoves and then find that it did a fine job of heating ONE\nroom and possibly two, but never much more unless they lived in Florida!\nInfo on my JUCA woodburners, and woodburning in general, is at\n<b><a href=\"juca/index.html\">Woodburning Furnace - JUCA</a></b>.\nFireplace, Woodstove - JUCA Super-Fireplaces. As to how it works\nso well, <b><a href=\"juca/info/works.html\">How a JUCA Woodburning Furnace Works</a></b>.</p><p>\n\nSo I suppose that I have a grudge against most modern advertising,\nbecause I keep looking for SOME commercial that does not wildly exaggerate\nactual abilities of some product and that does not intentionally\ndeceive viewers/readers into arriving at wrong conclusions.  If it were\nup to me, when ads said FREE, if those very expensive commercials\nwere not ACTUALLY giving away the things they claimed, I would\nwant to see them all sued!  Maybe some level of truth in advertising\nmight then re-appear!  In any case, THIS Domain makes a serious effort\nat avoiding such things, and tries to present honest facts and\nreliable logic, and even tries to AVOID letting readers accidentally\narrive at some wrong conclusions.  However, it probably will be\na LOT more boring than the exciting commercials that tell you that\nyou have already won a million dollars or will win a Hummer or that the\npromoter is going to GIVE you gold or money or gasoline or whatever!</p><p>\n\nOK.  I DO have some strange attitudes about some aspects of modern\nsociety.  Several years ago, I was disgusted and astounded to see\na TV news segment that described that 200 sports coaches in the\nState of Washington had been arrested and convicted IN THAT YEAR of molesting\nthe young children who trusted them and whose parents also trusted\nthem.  My mathematical mind quickly realized that if there were 200\nin just Washington State, and the US has roughly 50 times the population\nof Washington, that must have meant that there had been TEN THOUSAND\nsports coaches in the US that were arrested and convicted IN THAT\nYEAR.  And it's hard to even imagine how many thousands of others\nhave gotten away with their aberrant behaviors!</p><p>\n\nSo, MY \"strange attitude\" regarding such aberrant people?  Put\nthem in Prison for a year or two and then release them to do their horrible\nthings again?  <b>NO!</b>  No one could actually get away with doing this,\nbut just imagine if ONE such convicted pervert was taken into a \"Public\nSquare\" (maybe on a small stage in Times Square or a similar location)\nstripped and then <b>an accurate machete swing was used to perform a\n\"rapid public operation\",</b> probably with a lot of Reporters and\nTV cameras present to record the gross and gruesome event.  Yes, it would be\ncruel punishment for someone with a machete to \"chop off the offending\nparts\" in a fraction of a second.  And, yes, a medical doctor would need\nto be present to stop the bleeding that would certainly occur.</p><p>\n\nBUT JUST IMAGINE THE CHANGE OF BEHAVIOR OF THOSE THOUSANDS OF <b>OTHER</b>\nABERRANT SPORTS COACHES and the millions of others who abuse children.  They\nwould certainly all watch it as a video, watched millions of times on\nYou-Tube and FaceBook and elsewhere.  <b>The SINGLE example of such a\npublic spectacle, would certainly cause a shiver up the spine of such\nperverts, and a SINGLE SCENE could likely ensure the\nsafety of MILLIONS of children, couldn't it?</b></p><p>\n\n(I admit that I got this idea from the sick terrorists who have beheaded\npeople and videotaped it.  But I truly believe that if a SINGLE such\n\"public machete operation\" was performed and videotaped, millions\nof men would see that gruesome video on You-tube or whatever, and I think,\nwould DECIDE to never do things to little kids!  Would that be worth the\nsevere bending of the Constitution once?  Well, I'm not a Lawyer or a Supreme\nCourt Justice, so I do not know.  But I really suspect that an\n\"outside-the-box\" response like that, JUST ONCE, would\ncertainly make MILLIONS of little kids far safer.)</p><p>\n\nAs to having an effect on that one man, obviously it would, but that\nwould not be the point.  The intention would be that such a bizarre scene\nwould never have to be re-enacted.  The VIDEO of it being seen over and over\nby millions of men who might consider doing bad things to little kids,\nshould scare the daylights out of them.  The thought that the one part of\ntheir body that seems to drive them most, might get viciously chopped off!</p><p>\n\nOf course, in America, aberrant people all KNOW that such a thing\ncould never happen to them.  Even if they get caught doing the most\nhorrendous things to little kids, they get good food and a roof for a\nyear or two while in prison, and then they know they will be\nreleased to do it all again, to OTHER unsuspecting little kids.\nSEE why my \"strange attitude\" seems to make some sense!\nBut since that will never happen, there will be MILLIONS of children\nwho will be abused in every conceivable way, some of which will occur\non the very block on which you live!</p><p>\n\nI wonder if there might some day be ONE Convicted child molester who actually\nregretted his behavior and who might VOLUNTEER to be the participant\nin such a gruesome scene???  A Judge might even grant a Prison Release to\nsuch a convict that agreed to be the object of such a scene.  After all,\nthat man would never sexually molest anyone else again!  With a signed\ndocument that said that he knew what he was agreeing to!  In such a case,\nmaybe the Constitution might not need to get \"bent\" while still achieving the\ndesired goal of safety for millions of kids???\n</p><p>\n\n</p><hr>\n\nDown to more calm subjects now!<p>\n\nThis Domain contains presentations on many specific subjects in\nscience and Engineering.

Well, there are millions of people who have\nclaimed to witness ghosts, or have experienced ESP, and nearly as\nstrong a factual basis for the other two subjects above.  But the\nsame Physicists who humiliate people for saying such things, make\neven MORE un-factual and un-based statements, and consider them\nto be rock solid!  Funny!

I can't speak for other\nPhysicists, but I think I have at least a vague idea of\n\"real life\"  In fact, I am often amazed that the general\npublic often seems to have so little idea of what is actually going on\nregarding many subjects!

Don't people see\nthat even Oprah has failed to find any successful system, after\ncountless attempts?  Doesn't anyone see any problem there regarding\ncredibility?  Well, I see the problem as being that NO consumer of such\nprograms or products seems to have a Physicist's super-logical viewpoint!\nSo they actually think they are being told the truth, and they assume\nthat the concepts argued are valid!  <b>In contrast, consider (this)\nPhysicist's view:</b>  One pound of bodyfat in the body (actually\ncalled lipids or triglycerides) is made up nearly completely of carbon,\nhydrogen and oxygen, about 77% of it being carbon atoms.\n<a href=\"public3/weight.html#1\"><sup><b>footnote</b></sup></a> \n<b>Say you decide to somehow remove exactly one pound of\nbodyfat from your body (without surgery!).  That actually means that you\nhave to find some way to discard about 0.77 pound of carbon.</b>  This is\nnot quite as easy as it might first seem.  We know the body breaks lipids\ndown into simpler molecules (like by the Krebs Cycle) to get the energy\nout of it.  We know the body can get rid of hydrogen and oxygen VERY\neasily as water and in many ways, by sweating, by moisture in the breath, by\nurination, etc.  No problem there.  <b>But how many ways does a human\nbody have of getting rid of carbon?</b>  Do you know?  No one seems to!\nThe answer is essentially ONE!  It must convert the carbon into\ncarbon dioxide (by oxidation, in a process called Metabolism) and then exhale\nit as a maximum of 4.4% of your outgoing breath. (Dalton's Law of partial\npressures) <a href=\"#10\"><sup><b>footnote</b></sup></a>  THAT'S IT!  It has\nNO other significant way of dumping carbon!  The point\nbeing, in order to get rid of that one pound of bodyfat, the body has\nNO alternative except to have to EXHALE enough breaths in order to\nget rid of enough carbon dioxide that can contain that 0.77 pound of carbon!\n(Of course, this is PLUS the carbon that must get dumped due to the body's\nnormal daily Metabolism.)  I suppose that you mathematical sorts may have\nalready figured out that the 1.0 pound of bodyfat or the 0.77 pound of carbon\nwould require about 26,400 normal breaths, to get rid of all that\ncarbon!  A LOT!  The Physics logic\nseems crystal clear to me, but no one else seems to realize\nthese unavoidable facts.  (Physics could not really see all this in any\nother way!)<p>\n\nIt is even easy to confirm this is all true.  An average adult man eats\n(ballpark) around 2,200 Calories of food each day, and breathes about a total\nof (ballpark) 17,000 times each day.  Each average breath is about half\na liter of air, which, when exhaled at body temperature, can each contain a\nmaximum of about 22 milliliters of carbon dioxide in it, which is about\n0.0405 gram of carbon dioxide per average breath.  This includes 0.0110\ngram of carbon atoms in it.  In those 17,000 exhales each day, just\nmultiply to find that means a total of 681 grams of carbon dioxide or\n<b>189 grams of elemental carbon can leave the body each day by way of\nexhaled breath.</b> (Still following?)  The <b>2,200 Calorie daily diet\nincluded about 0.40 pound or 189 grams of carbon in the food.  That amount\nof carbon is processed throughout the body in the daily Metabolism</b>.  We\ncan therefore see that the NORMAL exhaled breath accounts for the same amount\nquantity of carbon that had entered the body during eating and digestion, and\nwe even now see WHY the body weight is therefore generally stable!</p><p>\n\n<b>By the way, virtually no one, including alleged experts, seems\nto know this fact!</b> I created that web-page in October 2009\n<b>../public3/weight.html</b>  During 2014, the British\nMedical Journal and ABC-News-Catalyst totally neglected my 2009 Research\nwork and they claimed that a man with a questionable education duplicated\nsome of my work in 2014.  In the scientific community, THAT is not\nsupposed to be allowed!  In any case, 24,000 people had read my 2009\narticle, BEFORE that guy ever came up with a partial idea, and before\nhe forgot to consider that human beings actually have to EAT to survive!</p><p>\n\nNearly everyone seems to assume that the food that we eat and\ndigest passes through the body to be excreted.  It obviously has to go\nSOMEWHERE, due to the scientific Law of Conservation of Mass!  But the\nreality is that essentially ALL the food that you actually digest\neventually leaves your body in your exhaled breaths!  NOT in the\nnastier way that people assume!</p><p>\n\nYou can probably see that if ANY of the variables regarding digestion\nOR BREATHING are changed, the body weight will likely then also change.\nGreater Calorie intake (without any increase in Metabolism or breathing\nrate) pretty much obviously means\nan increase in body weight.  Greater Metabolism and heavier breathing,\nas, for example, due to a lot of exercise (without any increase\nin the Calorie intake) and the body weight is nearly certain to decrease.\nPretty obvious, isn't it?  Probably too many numbers, sorry, but I\nwanted to build an air-tight case regarding this stuff.</p><p>\n\n<b>I hope you see that no assumptions were made in the discussion here (or\nin the 2009 Article), and simple and standard scientific knowledge and logic\nis all that has been used.</b>  This line of analysis forces accepting an\nentirely new (and somewhat bizarre!) set of conclusions!  Yes,\nwhether a person is obese or skinny IS related to their rate of\nMetabolism, but for an unexpected reason, apparently regarding their rate\nof breathing!  A skinny person loses heat more easily from the skin,\nfor having less thermal insulation, and so that person MUST have\nsomewhat faster Metabolism and faster or deeper breathing.  The converse\nis true for obese people, who seem very likely to breathe either more\nslowly or more shallowly, as a result of this effect.</p><p>\n\nExercise CAN certainly contribute toward weight loss, but IF the\nassociated breathing is not sufficient, the body could not actually\nget rid of the carbon atoms!  Isn't that really weird?\n<b>The consequence is that EXERCISE can get rid of bodyfat ONLY by\ndoing TWO things: increasing the Metabolic usage of energy stores (everybody\nhas long known that) AND INCREASING the breathing rate and depth.</b>\nEITHER ONE ALONE could not do it!  It really does not seem to matter\nwhether you can lift 700 pounds or not!  It may not even matter whether\nyou are fit or not, as long as you do some activity that causes your\nMetabolism to speed up AND causes you to breathe either deeper or faster or\nboth!  The faster metabolism part is also the actual reason why things like\nCocaine and Speeders (Amphetamines) tend to cause people to become skinny,\nby doing BOTH of those effects, (although such people often also\nforget to eat!)</p><p>\n\nThere is another confirmation of this stuff.  When Researchers\ndo Metabolism Studies on people, what they actual monitor is the\ncarbon dioxide exhaled in the breath!  They make an ASSUMPTION\nthat the instantaneous Metabolic Rate is necessarily proportional to the\nRespiration Rate, which is actually an extremely solid assumption, as it is\nnecessary for bodily equilibrium.  <b>But the fact that we have\nidentified TWO INDEPENDENT PROCESSES here</b> seems extremely\nimportant.  <b>If EITHER the Metabolic Rate or the Respiration Rate\nwas somehow restricted, the other would necessarily have to also\nbe restricted by the brain, in order to maintain bodily equilibrium.</b></p><p>\n\nI suspect that there is an easy Thesis for a Medical student here!\nObtain Physical Exam data for at least 1500 people who have deviated\nseptums (obstructed nose passageways) and that for 1500 others who do\nnot.  Do a Scientific Statistical Analysis of the BMI number (a\ncrude system of describing fitness by the metric body weight divided\nby the metric height squared), and it seems certain that the people with\nobstructed nasal passageways should be statistically heavier!  BECAUSE\nif less airflow can normally occur, then the brain would necessarily\nrestrict Basal Metabolism in order to maintain chemical\nequilibrium of the body.  If Respiration Data is also available, then\neven better Statistical Analysis could be done.</p><p>\n\nWhen a person is obese, it might therefore be because of EITHER\na Metabolic Rate that was too low for the food intake (with the\nrespiration rate automatically then being reduced by the brain) OR due to\na Respiration Rate that was too low to carry the carbon out of the\nbody (with the brain then automatically reducing the Metabolic Rate\nin response).</p><p>\n\nThe implications of this seem staggering!  <b>Say that your Metabolism\nwas fine and that your particular body simply had developed a habit\nof breathing 10% more shallowly or 10% less often than most people do.\nMaybe that is due to aging or a change to a sedentary lifestyle.\nNo one would ever notice this minimal difference.  But say that you then\ncould somehow LEARN (again) to breathe just 10% more deeply, with 0.50 liter\nof air in an average breath rather than your normal 0.45 liter.</b>  You might\nhave already learned to restrict your food intake to eating 1,980 Calories\nof food each day, which might keep you from gaining even more weight, but\nyou could not seem to lose any of the weight you have.  But now your body\nwould be able to exhale 10% additional carbon dioxide (equivalent to 2,200\nCalories per day).  (Remember that you had already learned a pattern of only\neating 1,980 Calories each day.)  <b>Simple calculations indicate that this\nsimple and easy change could represent a WEIGHT LOSS (of actual bodyfat)\nof around 0.4 pound per week or 22 POUNDS per\nyear!</b>.  It sort of boggles the mind to think that all those expensive\nweight-loss programs might not be necessary at all, and that many of them\nare apparently impossible to be effective!  And that a person might be able\nto lose really large amounts of actual bodyfat simply by learning a\npattern of breathing a little more deeply (or a little faster)!</p><p>\n\nA web-page describes the details and the math and science behind this at\n<b><a href=\"public3/weight.html\">Bodyfat, Weight Loss, the Physics of Body Weight Control</a></b>.</p><p>\n\nThere IS a caveat included above!  Those larger breaths ARE ABLE TO\ncarry away 10% more carbon.  Will it actually do that?  Don't yet\nknow!  It could happen that if your body has gotten really used\nto a slowed Metabolism, it might already  therefore only be supplying a\nsmaller amount of carbon to the lungs.  The CONCENTRATION of carbon\ndioxide might simply drop lower to carry away the usual amount.\nSo it might not be that your Metabolic Rate would increase just\nbecause the limitation of the Respiration Rate was lifted from it.\n<b>Your brain has to figure this out!</b>\nOnce you have taught your body to breathe slightly more, it MAY then\nbe necessary to also teach your body Metabolic Rate to also increase\nthat small amount.  Whether it would do it \"because it could\"\nor only after it was re-taught, is not yet known.\nSo it DOES seem important to consider exercise, which would have the\neffect of teaching your body to increase both.</p><p>\n\nThe footnote also includes some other interesting possible implications.</p><p>\n\nI recognize that as a Physicist, I am NOT an expert regarding\ndietary regimens and such, but the above logic is simply LOGIC!</p><p>\n\n</p><h2>Alternative Energy Devices and Systems</h2>\n\nIn \"alternative energy\", there are countless\nexamples of where inventors or manufacturers claim unbelievable\nthings!  The fact that neither they nor the public seems aware\nof the Conservation of Energy, seems to encourage that sort\nof thing!  They actually find ways to keep from being sued\nby such extravagant claims by describing what is called\nPEAK POWER RATINGS, instead of any PRACTICAL POWER RATINGS!<p>\n\nI use an analogy of people buying cars that are advertised as\nhaving 495 horsepower engines.  THAT is a PEAK POWER RATING, describing\nthe GREATEST POSSIBLE POWER PRODUCTION of that engine.  It is an\nirrelevant number, except for a couple seconds at a traffic light!\nCars are also described as having a certain fuel efficiency, a number\nof MPG, which is a far more useful number to know!  That same high-powered\ncar actually only produces around 40 horsepower in order to travel\nat constant speed on an Interstate Highway, where it then gets maybe\n25 MPG fuel efficiency.  THIS is a way of presenting PRACTICAL POWER RATINGS.\nThe two are EXTREMELY different.</p><p>  \n\nIn nearly all forms of alternative energy products, there is commonly\na factor of about ten to one of PEAK power to AVERAGE power.\nADVERTISING always presents PEAK power ratings, which are impressive!\nBut they are immensely misleading regarding AVERAGE performance which\na buyer might actually expect to get!</p><p>\n\nSo battery-powered vehicles always claim amazing performance\nwhile also claiming incredible GREENness and also that a standard\nextension cord can carry enough electricity to recharge it. \n<a href=\"#11\"><sup><b>footnote</b></sup></a></p><p>\n\nIn Hydrogen, the claims are even more outrageous, probably because even\nfewer people are capable of determining whether they are right or not.\n(Use the same footnote as above!)</p><p>\n\nIn PV, photovoltaics, ditto, where customers are led to believe that\nthey will be generating enormous amounts of electricity for their\nfamily to live a normal life. <a href=\"#12\"><sup><b>footnote</b></sup></a></p><p>\n\nThe footnotes show that with the simplest of examination, of figuring out\nhow much (PEAK) power (energy flux) is being claimed and also figuring out\nhow much (AVERAGE) power is actually likely available from the claimed\nsource, MANY such claims are immediately seen as wild speculation\n(or outright lies).</p><p>\n\nThe presentations in this Domain virtually always describe AVERAGE\nperformance, what can be EXPECTED by an actual buyer of such products.\nThere are also clear references to PEAK POWER RATINGS when the very\ninflated promotional claims are discussed.</p><p>\n\n</p><h2>Astrophysicists and Nuclear Physicists</h2>\n\nThis kind of questionable thinking even occurs WITHIN the Physics\ncommunity!  Physicists come up with the silliest and wildest speculation,\nand then aggressively claim it to be true, and NO ONE seems to ever even\ndo any analysis to see if the claims were credible or even possible!\nThere are many of these, and modern Physics seems to be chock full\nof \"theories\" which are absolutely devoid of any data\ndocumentation or support, and usually the author never even PRESENTED\nany valid logical case!  It didn't use to be like that in Physics!\nIn the old days, you had to provide immaculate logic, mathematics and\nempirical data to support even the tiniest point.  Here is one specific\nexample that amuses me!  A few years back, researchers were grumbling\nabout the fact that they had no direct access to rocks or other materials\nfrom Mars, in pursuit of trying to find whether there was ever water\nthere, and possibly even ancient life.  So, an unbelievably silly idea\nwas presented, and it quickly became absolutely accepted by the Physics\ncommunity.  The premise was that tiny rocks, actually meteorites, found buried\nin the ice of Antarctica, were (allegedly) all materials that had come from Mars!\nThey claim that either volcanoes on Mars, or incoming meteorites there,\ncaused such explosive blasts that what is called ejecta was launched\nupward.  They go farther and claim that the impact or the volcano was\nso powerful that the ejecta was launched at greater than escape velocity\nfrom Mars, so that the chunks of material were sent into outer space.\nAnd finally they claim that those many particles all hit the Earth\nin Antarctica and they are therefore SAMPLES of Mars that we can study.\nThere have been many Papers published which claim to describe Mars\nbased on study of those small Antarctica meteorites.<p>\n\nI guess in a common sense way, this could sound possible.  But they\nused so MANY speculative assumptions in their story!  ANY actual\nexamination of the logic and the numbers shows that to be a truly\nsilly claim!  Do they really believe that millions of tons of the\nEarth were launched out into space when the (alleged) huge meteorite\nended the dinosaur's reign?  I doubt it, and on Earth, such\nimpacts are far more explosive because of all the water that is\naround that can boil and create pressure.  But even go wild and say that a\nMILLION TONS of material from the Earth had gotten launched out into\nspace back then.  How much of that material would have hit Mars to land\nthere?  Well, this is a very simple problem regarding Spherical Geometry.\nFirst, consider the Moon, which is very close to us.  We can easily\ncalculate that the Moon takes up about five one-millionths of our whole\nsky.  If material had gotten launched out from Earth in random directions,\nroughly 0.000005 of it should have hit the (entire area of the) Moon.  Not that\ncomplicated! If a million tons had gotten launched (an astonishingly large estimate!)\nonly about five tons of it would have likely hit the ENTIRE surface of the\nMoon.  At its AVERAGE distance from us, the angular size of Mars takes\nup about 1/200,000 the angular area of the Moon, also very easy to\ncalculate.  So how much of the million tons (allegedly) ejected from\nEarth would have hit the ENTIRE surface of the planet Mars?  Well,\nthat fraction of the five tons, or a TOTAL of LESS THAN ONE-EIGHTH OUNCE of\nsuch material spread over the ENTIRE surface of Mars!  In the other direction,\nif Mars had ejected such an enormous amount, a million tons of ejecta,\nat some point in the past, the situation would have been essentially\nthe same, where less than ONE-FOURTH OF AN OUNCE could possibly have hit\nthe ENTIRE area of Antarctica (smaller than the area of Mars), certainly\nTOTALLING a size no larger a single kernel of corn!  (Keep in mind that\nTHIS would have only been possible if Mars had somehow ejected a MILLION TONS\nof material!)\nSuch very small particles of material tend to burn up as they enter our\natmosphere (as meteors) and only much larger ones usually make it through\nthe atmosphere to land.  Yet, those (alleged!) Physicists claim to have\nfound large numbers of such debris in just a very small area of Antarctica.\nShould DUHH be appropriate?  The SIMPLEST of math problems, which you just\nfollowed, shows how ridiculous that whole idea is!</p><p>\n\nIt is sad to note that, at the time this amazing claim was made,\nthere were some scientists who wanted to try to convince NASA to give\nthem more money for spacecraft to Mars.  Science had NOTHING to do with\nthose alleged \"discoveries in Antarctica\".  It was all just politics!</p><p>\n\nAlso, they didn't bother to even try to determine\nWHETHER material could actually be given escape\nvelocity speed to escape Mars in the first place.  That problem is somewhat\nmore complicated, but it easily shows that there was NO chance that any\nmassive amount of material was ejected, (just like as is true on\nEarth when violent volcanic explosions occur) unless the entire planet of\nMars was on the verge of being blown apart into two pieces!  And even then,\nnot much of it would have ever gone all the millions of miles to softly\nland on Antarctica!</p><p>\n\nThere is nothing wrong with SPECULATING about such ideas.  Creativity\nis a good thing!  But Physicists are SUPPOSED to immediately do\nsome math and logic analysis to see if what they want to claim is\neven possible.  In this case, it is NOT REMOTELY POSSIBLE, by proof\nprovided by very basic Laws of Science.  The really troubling thing\nis that the entire Physics community endorsed and adopted this\ninsane concept and it is now considered as virtually a certainty!\nDidn't ANYONE do those simple math exercises we just looked at?</p><p>\n\n(This HAS been realized as a foolish failure and corrected in the past\nfew years since we have landed several robotic landers that have\nanalyzed the soil of Mars. Those robots have now found chemical\ncompositions of Mars which are absolutely different from the small\nchunks of (probably normal meteorite) material that were found\nin Antarctica.  In fact, once the chemical analysis of those chunks were\nfinally done [which had NOT been done at first, it was simply ASSUMED],\nthose chunks found in Antarctica seem certain to have been ejected\nby EARTH volcanoes!  An example of rampant incompetence!)</p><p>\n\nAn obvious problem exists in Physics today!  There are all sorts of theories\nthrown around such as where someone claims that some large object hit the\nplanet Uranus so hard that it was knocked on its side to now rotate (very\nquickly) strangely (sideways).  Or that a similar huge collision knocked the\nEarth into its tilted axis that causes our seasons.  Don't those Physicists\nknow even the basics of Gyroscopic Precession where they can easily\nmathematically prove that such silly ideas are impossible?  Or around a dozen\nother similar claims of powerful impacts that allegedly caused\nenormous changes in the rotation of some planet.  Those things might sound\nfine to non-Physicists, but in Physics Kindergarten, we all learned\nabout the Conservation of Angular Momentum and its many consequences\nregarding gyroscopic motions.  NO Physicist who has a valid Degree\nshould possibly believe that ANY impact could massively alter\nthe spin axis of any planet.  In case they slept that day in\nKindergarten, they should get a bowling ball spinning fast, suspend it\non a gimbal mount and TRY to throw things at it or fire things at\nit to cause its spin axis to change.  Also, allegedly smart scientists\naggressively claim that the many trillions of tons of the Core of the\nEarth has completely flipped over, to then spin in the\nopposite direction, HUNDREDS OF TIMES, and even without\nany such ferocious impacts, for their explanation of why many rocks have\nevidence of the Magnetic Field of the Earth having\nreversed.  It turns out that a smart guy about 200 years ago named Euler\nPROVED that cannot be done!  And EVERY Physicist or even Physics student\ncan easily do that math to show that such claims are silly!\nIt is not even a very hard problem to prove!  How could so many stupid\nideas have gotten fully adopted as true?</p><p>\n\nThe Physics community has quite a few other concepts which have\nabsolutely NO actual basis, but which have become universally\naccepted as fact!  Around 1912, Einstein developed a mathematical equation,\nwhich another scientist, Schwarzchild, solved in 1916. For one specific\nsituation, Schwarzchild got a mathematical answer that became infinite,\nbecause the denominator of his answer became zero, at one specific location.\n<b>THAT mathematical \"singularity\" is the ENTIRE basis for the alleged existence\nof Black Holes!</b>  People added in assumptions, and later Physicists\naccepted those assumptions as valid and then added on lots of new ones.  NO\nBlack Hole has ever been seen or otherwise detected, but now there are many\nBOOKS written regarding subtle details of their (alleged) functioning!\nThousands of Physicists have spent their entire careers trying to (mathematically) \nprove some new assumptions they want to add in!  <b>And there may actually\nbe no such thing as Black Holes at all!</b></p><p>\n\nMany or most modern Physicists now believe that\nthe MAJORITY of the Universe is in zillions of tiny objects that we\ncannot see and will never be able to see.  And what is the basis for that\nDark Matter or Hidden Mass?  A SINGLE thing that confused Physicists\nof around the 1930s!  Hundreds of years ago, a guy named Kepler\ndiscovered some patterns in the movements of the planets, and then\nlater Newton mathematically prove why those patterns existed.  The result was\nthat Kepler created three \"laws\" regarding such things.\nKepler and certainly Newton absolutely KNEW that those laws were ONLY\nvalid BECAUSE nearly all the mass of the Solar System is inside the\nSun, or what is called a point source.  During the 1920s on, understanding\nof the motions of our Milky Way Galaxy were developing.  <b>For some\nincomprehensible reason, the Physicists decided that Kepler's laws\nmust apply for the Galaxy as they do for the Solar System.</b>  But that\nshould have been immediately obvious to all of them that the mass of\nthe Galaxy is all spread out, and it clearly cannot act as though\nall the mass was at a single point.  And then they\nsoon discovered that the motion of the Galaxy does NOT comply with\nKepler's laws.  Unbelievable!  They first made a horribly wrong\nassumption (since the mass of the Galaxy is distributed very broadly\nand Newton had earlier proved that Kepler's laws should immediately\nhave been dismissed as not applying),\nand then decided that we had enormous problems because the Galaxy was\nnot rotating as Kepler would have said!  How could they have made the\nfirst huge error, but then how could so many thousands of Physicists\nseen all this and not even questioned the bad assumptions?  And then\ndozens of foolish speculations which have all been dreamed up to\nresolve the (invalid) problems they saw existing!  (There actually IS a\nrather simple and obvious explanation of why the Galaxy rotates as\nit does, and it is entirely based on SIMPLE gravitation as Newton\npresented it!)</p><p>\n\nAs often happens, I am rambling!  Sorry!  I realize that you are an\ninnocent bystander and here is some cranky Physicist railing about an\nextremely small number of pseudo-intellectuals!  But there are half a dozen\nOTHER major areas within Physics where truly poor assumptions had\nbeen made and that NO ONE then challenged them!  So, in my opinion, modern\nPhysics is currently pretty screwed up!  Physicists seem free to dream\nup the most outrageous idea and then get silly ideas adopted without\nmuch question! It is truly sad.</p><p>\n\nPlease tolerate one more!  One you were probably taught in school was the\nTwins Paradox, where Einstein's Relativity Theory allegedly would cause\nidentical twins to become different ages!  General Relativity certainly has\nmany peculiar consequences,\nbut THAT does not happen to be one of them.  Some Physicists made a really\npoor assumption in the early 1960s, and no one ever questioned or\nchallenged their claims!  It is very frustrating, as Physics is commonly\nconsidered as the very pinnacle of intellectual fields.  How is it\npossible that so many very wrong ideas get developed and immediately get\nfully adopted as true?</p><p>\n\nI will chill out regarding Physics subjects and move on to things\nyou are probably actually interested in!

But \"important\"\npeople never Surf the web-in the first place, but even if they do,\nthey seem unwilling to allocate more than 15 seconds to any\npresentation!  So at most, they read a sentence or two.  In an amusing\nrelated fact, just from those 15 seconds, many of them then ASSUME\nthat they have a COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING of the entire presentation\n(which often took a number of years to research)!\n(They are virtually always wrong about that!)  There have actually\nbeen several dozen of those \"important people\" who have\nvisited my presentation on Global Warming.  I have received some\nvery insulting e-mails from such people (or more often their\nunderlings who can waste the time to send an e-mail to me!)\nwhere they rip into me for not understanding the Solar Constant\nand using a wrong and obsolete value for it (where they never\nread enough of my presentation to see that I include one of the\nmost comprehensive discussions anywhere on that matter!); or\nmy not understanding the effects of carbon dioxide in the\natmosphere (again, they never read enough to find that I again\ninclude one of the world's most comprehensive discussion on\nthat matter!).  I suppose it is really easy to be spouting\ncriticisms when you simply ASSUME you know what the text of a presentation\nactually says!  Sort of funny, actually!  But it essentially\nresults in NO actual leader in any government or major business\never being aware of the contents of these pages!  But many thousands\nof \"average citizens\" actually read and then (hopefully)\nactually learn interesting and important stuff!  Go figure!\n(I have a feeling that in ten or twenty more years, some of those people\nMIGHT actually decide to FIND THE TIME to read one or more of these\npresentations.  In some cases, that will be far too late for\nany actual actions on their part.  I find that extremely sad.<p>\n\nOf course, maybe they are correct in simply blowing all this stuff\noff.  There have been Physicists before me who have only had\nworthless and garbage ideas!  Who can say for sure that I don't\nbelong in that category?  It is up to any reader, who ACTUALLY\nwould read any of these presentations, to try to determine that!</p><p>\n\n</p><table width=\"100%\" bgcolor=\"#ddddff\" id=\"text7\" style=\"font-size: 14px;\">\n\n<tbody><tr><td>\nAn important comment seems appropriate here!  I was educated at the\nUniversity of Chicago as a scientist, and it seems that they did\na fairly good job inside my skull.  I actually think they FAIL with\nmany of their other students, but for a peculiar reason!  Nearly\nall of my classmates in Nuclear Physics were incredibly arrogant!\nThey simply could not imagine that they would EVER make any error!\nIn my opinion, they therefore probably made lousy scientists!<br><br>\n\nWhat an outrageous thing to say!  Here is why.  ALL humans sometimes make\nmistakes, make poor assumptions, use poor logic, and arrive at poor\nconclusions.  Even them!  Even me!  A CRITICAL characteristic of being a\ngood scientist is to NOT TRUST OR ASSUME ANYTHING!<br><br>\n\nUC (forced) me to take a Graduate-Level Mathematics class which I thought\nat the time was the dumbest ever!  It was a 13-week course, which had\na single goal, to prove that 1 + 1 = 2!  Do you agree in my initial\nattitude?  The Professor spent the first THREE WEEKS proving in\nexquisite detail that\n1 + 1 was not LESS than exactly 2.  Part of the reasoning was, what if\nwe had not been measuring accurately enough, that maybe 1 + 1\nactually equaled 1.99999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999\nand we just THOUGHT that quantity was 2!  Then three more weeks proving\nthat it was not GREATER than exactly 2.  Then three weeks more\nto prove that the sum was not a Complex number (which might have had\na Real component of 2 but also an Imaginary component).\nAnd more weeks proving that the sum of 1 + 1 did not happen to be\nin some Other Dimension (where again, the VISIBLE part might have\nthen looked like 2).  On the last day of Class in that thirteenth\nweek, the Professor closed out the logic, of establishing that\n1 + 1 was NOT equal to any other number or quantity, and therefore\nBY DEFAULT it WAS proven that it was exactly equal to 2!\n\nWhy was that Course so important to me?  For two separate important\nreasons.  <b>First, as a good scientist, it was CRITICAL to NEVER\nASSUME something is true, just because it LOOKS like it is true.</b>\n(For thousands of years, everyone on Earth believed that the Earth\nwas Flat, and that it could not possibly be spinning at over 1000 mph\nor hurtling through space at 66,000 mph in going around that bright\nthing up in the sky [the Sun]).<br><br>\n\n<b>Second, it is equally critical to NOT ASSUME THAT YOU ARE RIGHT!</b>\nSadly, I know many Physicists who have such huge egos that they\ncannot imagine that they could ever be wrong, and so even when\nthey dream up silly speculations, they insist that they are correct\n(without providing any proof or support other than common sense.)\nSOOOOO!  I am highly critical of many people who call themselves\nscientists who have this self-absorbed attitude!  <b>The CORRECT\nattitude of a good scientist is to ALWAYS ASSUME YOU ARE WRONG,\nand then therefore start doing the math and Physics to try to\nconfirm that you are right.</b><br><br>\n\nIn my case, I OFTEN have come up with \"dumb ideas\"\nwhich really sounded good to start with, but then when the\n(mandatory) math and strict logic was applied, showed themselves\nto be the dumb ideas they were!<br><br>\n\nSo THIS is the lesson of this Commentary:  <b>IF you want to be a quality\nscientist, you MUST generally assume that your ideas had been wrong,\nand then immediately dig into the necessary math and Physics\nto try to confirm or deny your ideas!</b>  \"Let's build a\n4,200-foot-long bridge across the Golden Gate waterway.\" \"Will it\nfall down?\" \"I dunno, let's build it and find out!\".\nScience (and Engineering) cannot be like that!<br><br>\n\nThe presentations in this Domain often include a lot of (annoying)\nformulas and calculations!  Generally, they are provided so that\nany reader might then be able to \"do the math\" to\nconfirm or deny statements made.  After all, are you SURE that 1 + 1 = 2?<br><br>\n\n</td></tr></tbody></table><p>\n\nIf a reader of this happens to be an electronics technician or hobbyist,\nI would have great interest in discussing the possibility of hiring\nor collaborating on several of these projects that involve various\nlevels of advanced electronic circuitry.  It has really been very\nfrustrating for me to not have the necessary advanced microwave\nelectronics skills to get my Rape Prevention System (PSST)\n<a href=\"psst/index.html\">Rape Prevention Personal Security System - PSST</a>\noperational.  Microwave is not necessary for the Non-Intrusive\nElectronic Medical Anesthesia, but I still do not have sufficient\nskills in those areas.  A far simpler system is a game system to\nencourage children to be extremely active to minimize obesity.</p><p>\n\nOn a different front, if a reader happens to be good at\nCompositional skills, the weaknesses of these many presentations\nare pretty evident, even to me!  I was trained in College as\na Physicist, and my whole life has had strong interests in math and\nscience.  NOT in Composition!  Rearranging many of the presentations\nwould make them much more readable, no doubt!  People usually smile when\nI tell them that I actually TRY to compose introductory and closing\nparagraphs, and to not do so much repeating of concepts!  I really,\nreally have tried!  These are abilities I do not seem to have.\nIn a few cases, the existing web-page is around the fiftieth\nrevision, and you DON'T want to know what the first one was like!\nSo, there are a few which are now \"tolerable\", but only due\nto massive efforts!  I am absolutely sure that an English Major\ncould re-arrange and re-word a presentation in an hour or less.\nVolunteers would be appreciated, even if it only regarding a\nspecific subject presentation that interests you!  However, the\nseveral people who have offered to \"re-write\" my\npages seem to have all been insistent in massively CHANGING concepts or\nignoring the science or the math.  I have realized that their\nmotives have been good, of enhancing understandability, but why\ndo they seem to insist on introducing their OWN \"improvements\"\nto scientific concepts which I had spent months or years in\nstudying?  In any case, I cannot say that I really want to\nconvert any of my pages into 15-second sound-bytes which present\nTHEIR ideas rather than my research.  So this area has been\ndisappointing so far.</p><p>\n\nThere is yet another situation where a talented writer who understands\nsome science might want to get involved!  In 1989, I composed an\noutline for a story which is technically science fiction but it is so\nsolidly based on actual science that it might turn out to actually be\ntrue scientifically!  I would think that some talented author who was\nwilling to work with me might make an impressive reputation and career,\nas well as bushel baskets of money!  I have decided to present the\nbasic outline of the first few Chapters (of 25 Chapters of the entire\nstory), such that a prospective author might get a glimpse of the basic ideas of\nmy book. <b>Is this Science-Fiction or is it actual science?</b></p><p>\n\n<a href=\"public4/ufodna01.html\">UFO - DNA - Chapter 1 - Introduction, the Invitation</a><br>\n<a href=\"public4/ufodna02.html\">UFO - DNA - Chapter 2 - The Flight to the Luxury Island</a><br>\n<a href=\"public4/ufodna03.html\">UFO - DNA - Chapter 3 - Arrival on the Luxury Island</a><br>\n<a href=\"public4/ufodna04.html\">UFO - DNA - Chapter 4 - Vacation Welcome by the Richest Scientist on Earth</a><br>\n<a href=\"public4/ufodna05.html\">UFO - DNA - Chapter 5 - Beaches, Fun and Dinner</a><br>\n<b><a href=\"public4/ufodna06.html\">UFO - DNA - Chapter 6 - Regarding Our ET DNA Beings</a></b>. <br>\n<b><a href=\"public4/ufodna07.html\">UFO - DNA - Chapter 7 - Regarding the Future of Mankind</a></b>. <br>\n<b><a href=\"public4/ufodna08.html\">UFO - DNA - Chapter 8 - Regarding the History of Life on Earth</a></b>.</p><p> \n(Remaining 17 Chapters, altogether about 25 Chapters)</p><p>\n\n\n<br><br>\n<b><a name=\"menu\"><font size=\"5\">Public Encyclopedia Services Main Menu</font></a></b></p><p>\n\n<b><a href=\"public/publicme.html\">Author History - These Public Services</a></b><br>\n\n<b><a href=\"public3/politic.html\">Presidential Politics</a></b> - and Barack Obama<br>\n\n<b><a href=\"#8\">To FIX the Stock Market!</a></b><br>\n\n<b><a href=\"#9\">To FIX the American Economy!</a></b><br>\n\n<b><a href=\"public3/hamas00.html\">Israeli-Palestinian Situation Suggestion</a></b>. <b>A Possible Solution</b><br>\n\n<a href=\"public3/interest.html\">Dell Computer Corporation Bad Behavior</a>. <b>Really Bad Behavior of Dell Computer Corporation</b> endangering at least $300,000 of business, and other interesting subjects!</p><p>\n\n<a href=\"citation.html\">Citing a Web-Page in the mb-soft.com Domain</a></p><p>\n\nAnd, yes, I realize that the cursor is strange and somewhat annoying,\nbut it also has a cuteness that is entertaining (for a while!)\n<font size=\"-1\">If you are a kid, you might watch to see which is the\nlast butterfly to still be flapping its wings!

Instead of being the current cost of around $100,000 per year per inmate for Federal prisoners, these inmates would be of minimal cost, mostly for only a few nearby Guard boats and Guards. The society on this artificial island would be nearly self-sustaining, and Inmates that enjoy the experience would be allowed to stay and be paid for their work after their time is done.

I wish!</b>\nOn July 21, 2002, one of their own Thornton Police Officers, and\nwho was also the Fire Chief of Thornton, Illinois, Chief John W. Klaczak,\nwas arrested for having molested some young boys in his Fire Cadet\nProgram, apparently for several years. The Village apparently\nfelt media pressure and decided to try to smear the reputation of\na stranger, me, who happened to be a Christian Minister (which they\ndid not know!), and who then lived 65 miles away in a different\nState (Indiana), to try to distract the newspaper and television\nattention from their own failings.<br><br>\n\nSo, during the first week of school in September 2002, five weeks after\ntheir Fire Chief Klaczak had been Arrested, they sent three Police\nCars to the local Wolcott Elementary School to take three children out\nof three different Grades of school for the day to \"interrogate\"\nthem (the children's later description) about me! No one in the\nVillage or their Police Department ever talked to me about any of this!\nIn fact, <b>I was unaware that any of this had even happened until\nthree years later (May 2005) when those children happened to overcome their\nfears and visited me and told me! And each Officer had\nmade up slightly DIFFERENT lies, all horrific, which they told those\nchildren.</b>  The oldest boy, then 12, was told that the Police had\n\"absolute proof\" that I had supposedly molested dozens of\nother little boys before him!  (It seems rather clear to me that if\nsuch claims had actually been true, then such a criminal would\nhave been spending many years in Prison, rather than spending years\nas a popular Christian Minister of a little 501-C-3 Church in Indiana!)\nThe Officers were clearly unaware that I was a Christian Minister, and\nthat I had even given several Sermons regarding the many terrible\ntreatments that children are forced to endure.  The Officers were\nclearly hoping that I had at least TOUCHED one of the kids at some time\n(which I had never done, not even a handshake!), and <b>that any or all\nof the three children might have said something which seemed to support\nthe lies that the Police Officers had made up</b>.  They knew that\nlittle kids would never doubt Police Officers!  The Police Officers\nobviously realized that a nine-year-old girl would not understand that\nsame lie, so the different Officer made up DIFFERENT lies which they\ntold to her.  A third set of lies were made up to tell the other boy.<br><br>\n\nIt is frightening how possible it might have been for any of those\nchildren who might have been so intimidated by being Interrogated by\nPolice as to simply agree with any of those Police lies, and I would\nhave then spent the rest of my life in Prison somewhere! The children\nwere SCARED (which I only learned three years later when they next\ntalked to me), and apparently the next day, the rumors around that\nSchool were conveniently filled in by the Police and by Village\nemployees, so everyone in the Village knew of those lies\n<b>EXCEPT FOR ME!</b><br><br>\n\nFive years later (May 2007), in a casual conversation with the\ngirl who had been nine during the \"interrogation\" she happened to\nmake a pretty bizarre comment to me about the Police Officer\nwho had \"interrogated\" her in Sept 2002.  She was older then (14)\nand she smiled as she asked if I knew why the Officer had asked\nher \"about two dozen times\" if I had been wearing \"pants or shorts\"\nwhile I had been pulling weeds in my yard or while I had been mowing\nmy lawn!  How dare a Police Officer ask a little girl, over and\nover, such an aberrant question?  Does Thornton have a \"Dress Code\"\nfor people who were pulling weeds in their own yard?  Her 14-year-old\nsmile suggested to me that she realized how bizarre the Police\nOfficer had been.  I have long wondered since she informed me\nof that Twilight Zone type stuff if there is an \"official\ntranscript\" of that \"interrogation\" of her, where two dozen\nsuch questions of the Thornton Police Officer might be in some\nofficial archive!  But I cannot imagine that the Thornton\nPolice Department could be so stupid as to KEEP such transcripts!\nMy guess is that such records have been \"lost\"!<br><br>\n\nThis is mostly \"ancient history\" from about 2002, but I feel\nthe need to add an extra paragraph here in December 2014.  I am\nnot a Black, but I can relate to recent stories in the news\nabout incredibly bad behavior of Police to Blacks.  I feel like\nI am a Retired White man in their situation!  Once I learned of this\nincredible Police Misconduct, beginning in May 2005, I repeatedly\ncontacted EVERY Cook County, Illinois State and Federal Agency\nabout this. Every Agent I contacted ALL instructed me to \"go to the\nThornton Police Department to File a Report!\"  I saw that as absolute\ninsanity!  In a very small Department, what would happen to any\nReport I might try to File which might cause \"their own brothers\"\nto be sent to prison?  Yeah, right.  I had tried to contact at\nleast 45 different County, State and Federal Agencies, even including\nPolice Internal Affairs (regarding Police Misconduct) of both\nCook County and Chicago.  <b>There were two incredibly important\ndetails which I then did not know!  The Federal Government passed\nsome Laws where NO ONE is allowed to ever file any Lawsuit against\nany Municipal government or against any local Police Department.</b>\n(the Municipal Government and Municipal Police Department clearly\nmust feel quite comfortable in having behaved in such offensive and\nillegal ways for these past ten years or more).  <b>On July 30, 2007, I\ncalled a Diane Gaster of the Public Integrity Division of the\nIllinois State's Attorney's Office,</b> as I was informed that her Office\nhandled Police Misconduct regarding Officers in the Towns and Villages\nof Cook County, Illinois.  She told me that she saw absolutely nothing\nwrong in anything the Thornton Police had done!  <b>She then told me\nthat if I did not like how the Thornton Government and Police enforce\nthe community, I should just sell my house and move to some other\narea!  And then she HUNG UP ON ME!</b> The other detail I did not\nthen know about was that the Village is apparently functionally a\nMonarchy where the government and Police are absolutely free to do\nanything they wish), <b>The Form of government of Thornton, Illinois\nis a version of Home Rule, which pretty much gives them\namazing freedom to do anything they wish.</b><br><br>\n\nI am not a Lawyer, but it sure seems to me that since there were\nTHREE different Officers involved, each fabricating slightly DIFFERENT\nlies about me on the same day, that seems to me to be absolute\nproof that they had Pre-meditated those actions and they could not\nhave been accidental mis-statements or the actions of a single\nrogue cop.  In other words, isn't that absolute proof that the\nThornton Police Department CHOSE to destroy my career as a Minister,\nmy reputation as an admired person, and my life?  And doesn't that\nseem to suggest the word Felony, regarding their behavior?  And it\nseems to explain why the highly admired, long-term Chief of Police\n(Arnold) very suddenly resigned in 2006, without even giving any two\nweek notice and he listed and sold his house and\nmoved to an unknown destination, a few days after an FBI Agent\nfriend of mine (T.S.) had called him about my situation.  Everyone was\nshocked when he left so suddenly, leaving Thornton in a difficult\nspot of unexpectedly having to find a new Chief of Police, and\nwhere he left a probable lifetime job of high pay to become\nunemployed?  But a Chief of Police is responsible for his Officers,\nand when SEVERAL OFFICERS were involved, AND an FBI Agent called\nhim about my situation, I could see how he might have realized he\ncould be in very deep trouble!<br><br>\n\nEmployees of the Police Department and the Village of Thornton have then\nspent the following EIGHT YEARS (and counting) in repeating those lies over and over to each and all\nof the 2,000-plus residents of Thornton.  As a result, not one resident\nof Thornton has ever said a word to me in the past seven years,\nwhich was also nearly true of the whole ten years.  (The Police had never\nbothered to EVER even TALK to me about ANY subject, partly because I then\nlived 60 miles away in Indiana and only would be briefly in Thornton every few weeks\nto mow the lawn.)<br><br>\n\nThose Police were obviously unaware that as a Christian Minister,\nor that I had given a number of\nSermons about the Sins of many aberrant sexual behaviors, including\nthose involving children and homosexuals and cheating.  I have never\nunderstood how some Churches seem to overlook a Commandment of God\nin deciding to permit and even encourage some behaviors!<br><br>\n\nIn a bizarre way, the people who run Thornton, Illinois enabled\nme to better understand the story of Jesus and His Crucifixion.\nEven though I have long been a Christian Minister, I had never\nreally grasped how Jesus could have been so \"Perfect\" and yet the\nCommunity misunderstood Him so badly that they chose to have Him\nexecuted by Crucifixion.  Thornton, Illinois has aggressively treated\nme, a Christian Minister, amazingly badly, by having made up horrific\nlies about me and then repeated those lies so often that every single\nresident of Thornton really came to believe that I am \"evil incarnate\".\nI certainly have heard stories about communities treating outsiders and\npeople who they believed were different than themselves, badly, but\nI really never imagined that a community could treat a law-abiding\nChristian Minister in such a disappointing way.  And for twelve and\na half years, and running!<br><br>\n\nThere seem to be some examples which might show that I am actually\na nice and even potential admirable person!  Since November 2000. I have\nGIVEN AWAY the plans and information for a system that nearly anyone\ncould use to fully air condition their homes FOR FREE.  At least 21,000 people\nhave installed it so far.  But I have made available a \"Technical Packet\"\nfor anyone who feels they have an unique application.  In order for me\nto send out the TP, I require that the recipient GIVE $250 as cash,\nto any credible Charity (and not a dime to me!) At least 9,400 people have\nrequested the TP so far.  Trusting that they have each honored their word\nabout the Good Deed I have nudged them to make, that indicates that THEY\nhave collectively GIVEN over $2,300,000 to wonderful activities!

Why is the sky blue?.\n<br><br>\n\nAnd this attitude toward me has never wavered in the following thirteen\nyears.  <b>Thornton has made me pay around $3000 every year for Property Taxes\nfrom 2002 through 2014, around $40,000 total I paid to the Village.  Shouldn't\nI have gotten some \"Civil Rights\" for that?  But all I seem to have\ngotten from Thornton during those 13 years has been harassment.</b>\nFor example, on March 24, 2014, as I was walking the two blocks\nback home from the Public Library, a local dog ran out into the street\nto attack me and bite the back of my left leg.  I had to hobble the\nremaining half block to my house to be able to call 911.  Several\nPolice cars and an Ambulance showed up.  They all looked at the bite\nmarks on my leg, but no one wrote anything down except for my name and\naddress.  One of the Ambulance men tried to get me to ride to a Hospital\nabout the leg injury, but when I asked, he said that I probably would\nbe billed around $600 for that.  I felt that I should be able to drive\nto a Hospital if I felt it necessary.  One of the older Police Officers\nabsolutely assured me that that dog would NEVER endanger me again.\nNONE of the Police Officers identified themselves to me.<br><br>\n\n<b>Less than TWO DAYS LATER, March 26, 2014, the SAME dog attacked me again, on\nmy way to the Library!</b>  When Thornton Police answered my 911 call, (less than\na block away) the Officer took 25 minutes to respond, and it was very\ncold that morning (24°F) and I got VERY cold standing along the\nstreet waiting for the Police Car.  When he finally arrived, I politely\nasked to sit in the warm Police Car and the Cop IMMEDIATELY and GRUFFLY\ndenied that request.  He made clear that he did not have any questions\nand had no intention to File any Report.  (The Thornton Village Ordinances\nREQUIRE that he Filed such a Report, and also that he Issued two Citations\nfor the dog \"running at large\" and for the dog \"attacking a person\").\nFrom inside his warm Police Car, that Officer made totally clear that\nhe was NOT about to File any Citation on the dog owner or to restrict\nthe dog's movements in any way!<br><br>\n\nThe behavior of the SECOND Police Officer was so offensive that I\ncontacted the Thornton Police Department to learn his identity.  <b>They\nwould NOT even tell me the name of the Officer who had answered my 911 call!</b>\nThey also would not tell me the identities of any of the several\nOfficers who had arrived at my house two days earlier!  They were\nclearly INTENTIONALLY keeping all their identities secret!  Strange!\n<b>I had not realized that Police were free to keep their identities secret!</b>\nI had only heard of the Nazi Staatsi Police doing that!<br><br>\n\nI am a pretty persistent person.  I initiated a FOIA (Freedom of Information\nAct) request for both of those times when I had been attacked by that\ndog.  Apparently, the Thornton Police Department handles all FOIA Requests.\nAnd they processed mine in the way I might have expected.\nA few days later, I got mail responses.  Regarding the SECOND dog attack,\nI learned that NO Police Report was ever Filed, and that no record\nwhatever of that event was ever created.  Not even any record of\nmy 911 call! Or that Officer's identity. <b>The FOIA Response explained that\nthe Officer always has the discretion\nregarding whether ANY Police Report ever gets created</b> (I don't think that\nwas true or legal), and the (unidentified) Officer had decided that\nhe did not need or want to file any Report.  The FOIA Response also informed\nme that the Officer never even bothered to talk to the dog owner, nor Filed\nthe MANDATORY Citation for the $500 Fine for the dog not being on a leash\nor the other MANDATORY Citation for at least $500 for the dog having\nattacked a person.  <b>How did the Officer get away with ignoring so many\nThornton Ordinances?</b>  After all, I have paid $40,000 in Property Taxes \nwhich has partly gone toward paying Thornton Police Officers, including him\n(whoever he is).  Is the dog owner a more important citizen than me where he\ngot to slide on two significant MANDATORY Citations and Fines?<br><br>\n\nI learned that no Officer had ever Issued the similar MANDATORY Citations and\nFines from two days earlier and that dog bite on my leg that they all saw.\nI also learned that Thornton Dog Ordinances have MANDATORY Impoundment\nof ANY dog which has bitten, attacked or threatened any person, but\nnone of that happened regarding that dog.  NO Fine, NO Citation and\nNO Impoundment, either time!  <b>IF I have any \"Civil Rights\" in the Village\nof Thornton, Illinois, they are hard to see.</b>  In contrast, the dog which\nhad (by then) attacked me twice in two days, seems to have unlimited\nrights, even regarding several very specific Thornton Village\nOrdinances.  The Thornton Village dog Ordinances even include one regarding\na dog which had previously bitten anyone, where such a <b>dog was to be\nImpounded and Destroyed if it should ever attack any other person.</b>\nHere, there was a dog which clearly merited that Ordinance of immediate\nDestruction, within less than a two day interval!<br><br>\n\nThe dog owner never had the slightest incentive to control his dog,\nhaving never received any of the MANDATORY four Citations nor the\nMANDATORY four $500 Fines nor the two MANDATORY Impoundments nor\nthe MANDATORY Destruction of that dog.  As a result, that dog continued to\nfreely roam Thornton. Two months later, on June 7, 2014, <b>when I stepped out\nof my kitchen door to get something from my vehicle in front of my garage,\nthe SAME dog attacked me a third time, this time on MY property!\nI was only three steps from my kitchen door!</b><br><br>\n\nWhen an Officer arrived after (this third) 911 dog attack call, the Officer\nmade clear that NO Citation would be given the dog owner and NO Fine.  <b>The\nOfficer explained\nto me that \"since I did not have any eyewitness\", he had no reason to\nbelieve MY word over the behavior of that dog!  I pointed out that THIS\ndog attack had occurred on MY PROPERTY, just three steps from my kitchen\ndoor! I pointed out that I am a Christian Minister, but my word clearly is\nnot to be believed over a repeatedly dangerous dog!</b><br><br>\n\n<b>I asked THIS Officer about the certainty that I, a Thornton Taxpayer,\nclearly could not safely ever walk down the very street I live on, as\nthe Village seemed to have given unlimited rights to the offending dog\nand its owner.  The Officer had no answer to that.</b>  <b>In the year\nsince the three dog attacks in 2014 (so far) I have NEVER walked down\nANY street or sidewalk in Thornton or even in my own yard, as the Thornton\nPolice have made clear that they have no intention of protecting my safety\nfrom dog attacks!</b>  I had spent my 68 years in enjoying walking, which I considered\ngood exercise and healthy sunshine.  I commonly would walk the half-mile\nto the Post Office to mail a single letter, mostly for the exercise,\nbut I also walked the quarter-mile to the Public Library for the\nsame reason.  I am now denied these behaviors that I thought all\nAmericans freely had, even just walking down the wonderful street I\nlive on.  Due to the third attack which occured five feet from\nmy house back door, I have been rather terrified when I need to try to\nmake it the twenty feet to my pickup truck!  Maybe Thornton finds it\nentertaining that I no longer can walk to the Library, but this is supposed\nto be America, and I am supposed to have some rights! Just what have\nI paid that $40,000 in Property Taxes for?<br><br>\n\nIt has seemed to me that OTHERS in Thornton are in danger of being\nattacked by that dog, possibly children.  Had any of those Thornton\nPolice Officers Enforced the many Thornton dog Ordinances regarding\nthe three attacks on me, maybe children and others might now be safer.\nI notice that there have been repeated screams from a Postal Carrier\nas he passed the dog owner's house.  I wonder if Thornton Police give\nany credibility to his being attacked by that same dog?<br><br>\n\n<b>The Village of Thornton also decided that they had the authority\nto do Warrantless Wiretaps on my house, beginning at least by mid-2002.</b>\nThis was within months of when President Bush had passed the\nPatriot Act which gave the Federal government such authority regarding\npossible terrorists.  The Village of Thornton decided that they\nhad that authority to use against a Christian Minister!  But Thornton\nactually went far further than the Federal government ever does,\nin not only READING my e-mails and listening to my phone calls but\nalso INSERTING hundreds of thousands of image files into my\nshut-off computer inside my securely locked house!\nI never understood how or why when I would arrive to mow the lawn, and\nUNLOCKED the securely locked house and TURNED ON the computer, it often\nhad thousands of new files in it!  They were IMAGES of very disgusting\nthings that I guess a Police Department has access to, and\nwhich they somehow were inserting into my TURNED OFF computer inside\na LOCKED HOUSE during those periods of weeks when I was not even\nin the State of Illinois!  On ONE such trip, I had to delete over\n7,000 image files from my computer!\nIt seemed to me that a small percentage of the files they put into my\ncomputer really seemed to qualify as illegal. Most of the images\nthat showed up in my computer seemed to be nudist photos, which I\nunderstand are actually legal. Many of the others seemed to be of\nolder women, which I understand are also legal. I wonder where\nthe Thornton Police obtained such photos, and I can only guess\nthat it was by (Fourth Amendment illegal) monitoring other people's\ncomputers, but that is only a guess as to where they got such a\nhuge number of such photos.  I even found it necessary\nto continue to use an obsolete computer Windows95 system, in order to\nbe able to FIND all the files they were regularly inserting into\nmy computer, as newer computers make it very difficult to find and\nreally delete files.  (even when you THINK you deleted a file, modern\ncomputers still keep hidden copies of absolutely everything!) The behaviors\nof Thornton Police and Thornton Village employees caused some changes in\nmy personal existence such as this.  Ditto regarding vetoing the\nidea of using Wi-Fi or any other fast system, which would have\nmade it far easier for the Village to have been inserting files\nin my computer, so I was forced to always continue to use\nan antique Dial-Up Modem for all e-mail and internet contacts.\nMy friends always made fun of me for using such slow connections,\nbut I could never explain to them WHY I was doing that!<br><br>\n\nA new thought has occurred to me in 2015!  Since I had never really\ncarefully looked at all the images that Thornton had inserted into\nmy computer, until recently, I had not realized that many thousands of the\nimage files that Thornton inserted into my old computer were pictures which\nI COULD NOT have obtained!  They were photos of often hundreds of OLDER women\nattending \"male stripper\" nights, where many of the women were having\nvarious forms of sex with the male strippers.  As I understand it, no men\nare ever allowed to attend such Male Stripper nights. The new thought was that\nthousands of those women who had apparently PAID to attend the Male Stripper\nnight were elderly, or obese, or ugly, which seemed to confirm that they\nwere local residents who had PAID to get their jollies, and probably did NOT\nwant their husbands and relatives to ever see photos of them having sex with\nmale strippers!  So the new thought is whether Thornton or whatever\nother town Police had installed HIDDEN CAMERAS, so they could collect\npossible morals evidence for future arrests.  I thought that it was\ncalled Prostitution for people to pay money and then have sex???  Or\ndoes that only apply regarding MALE patrons???  In any case, such Police\ncertainly would NOT have wanted Thornton to be distributing such \"evidence\"\nphotos, of some RESPECTED LOCAL ELDERLY WOMEN having sex with Male\nStrippers, as such respected elderly women might sue the Police\nDepartments for collecting such photos of them!  Additionally, aren't\npeople who have such photos taken of them REQUIRED to SIGN A RELEASE\nregarding THEIR IMAGE???  In other words, the fact that Thornton chose\nto try to USE around 40,000 such photos against ME (or more technically, my\ncomputer), didn't they realize the trouble I might have caused them\n(and apparently other Police Departments) if I had disclosed those\n40,000 photos to newspapers or other news media?  Thornton had\ninserted virtually all of those images between 2002 and mid-2008 (when the\nphone company had found their electronic transmitter / receiver inside the\nphone company equipment box outside my house in mid-2008)  Since I actively\ndeleted as many thousands of such image files as Thornton was inserting\ninto my computer, I imagine that by 2015, I probably no longer have\naccess to most of those Male Stripper image files.\nSo, I suppose those elderly women are probably safe from being put out\nof their closet, at least by me!  I wonder how many other millions of\ntheir images of such paying-women-customers having sex with Male\nStrippers are now sitting in Police Department computers!<br><br>\n\n\nA partial explanation arrived on May 7, 2003, when in a casual phone\nconversation (about other matters, regarding matters of a family\nliving near the Mayor that the Mayor felt were \"undesirables\"),\n<b>the Mayor of Thornton happened\nto mention that ANY employee of either the Thornton Police Department\nOR the Thornton Village government\nalways had the freedom to ENTER ANY HOUSE OR BUILDING IN THORNTON.</b>\nI thought I was correcting the Mayor in mentioning that he\nmeant only the Police and only with a Search Warrant from a\nJudge, but Mayor Swan immediately corrected me.  He explained that\nNO Search Warrant was EVER necessary, and that ANY employee of\nEITHER the Police Department or the Village government could do\nsuch entries, as they wished!  Neither the Mayor nor I realized during that\nconversation that I might have been a target of such bizarre\nentry, as he was actually referring to a family in the Village that\nwere considered \"troublesome\" (and Black) in his comments.\nA year earlier, on two different mowing visits, I\nhad found the interior of my LOCKED house to be severely disrupted,\neven though no door or window had been\nbroken, and nothing seemed to be stolen.  As a good scientist, I\nrealized that a nearly brand new vacuum cleaner which had been\nsitting in the kitchen both times, LIKELY had NO fingerprints\non the long pipes of the vacuum, and when I checked them for\nfingerprints, I found several fingerprints which were clearly\nnot mine. There was also an empty diet soda can sitting on my\nkitchen counter (I have NEVER drunk any diet sodas in my life)\nand I knew that pop cans are manufactured, boxed and shipped\nby machines, with absolutely no fingerprints on them, so the fact\nthat I found very clear fingerprints on that can, I had\nabsolute evidence of who had gotten into my (locked) house.\nIt was about two years later that I finally got samples\nof the Mayor's Secretary's fingerprints, which exactly matched\nthe ones found inside my (locked) house.  But at the time, I did NOT\nknow WHO the fingerprints belonged to, only that they clearly\nidentified whoever had gotten into my house.  The Mayor's casual comments\nin that phone conversation some months later caused me to suddenly\nrealize that it had been employees of the Village who had gotten\ninto my house (both times).  In fact, about a year after that, I\nwas able to confirm that it had been the Mayor's own part-time\nSecretary (Karen Leoni) who had entered my house and clearly spent several\nhours in it, both of those two times.  IF she also entered it at other\ntimes, she did not commit the extensive disruption of the contents\nof the house.  Regarding HOW she got into my locked house, I am\nfully aware that the Police have many methods of getting inside\nlocked cars and houses.<br><br>\n\nAnother part-time employee, a Harry Nolan, officially began the paperwork\nto have my house first Condemned and then Demolished, THREE DIFFERENT\nTIMES (June, August and September), all during 2003.  Mr. Nolan even\nadmitted that he had never even seen my house (which was less than\ntwo blocks away from his office)! One of those\ntimes came within one day of having a Judge authorize my house\nbeing Condemned, still without it ever having even been seen!<br><br>\n\nYou can probably guess at how hard it would be to be a Christian Pastor\nin a community where every resident was regularly re-told the horrific\nlies that the Thornton Police had made up to destroy my career and my life.<br><br>\n\nDuring the year 2006, the Village seemed to get especially aggressive\nin their efforts at harassing me.  A Teller at my Bank joked with\nme one day regarding my \"checking my bank balance every single\nday in their web-site\" and I responded by saying that I had\nno clue as to how to even do that.  Upon my request, the Teller\ndiscovered that it was the Village of Thornton checking my bank\nbalances.  Rather odd!  But they were also monitoring and reading\nmy incoming and outgoing e-mails, and they even decided to send their\nown out-going e-mails to anyone who indicated that they were about to\nsend me a check in the mail!  My previously thriving business\nof providing excellent fireplace doors at nice discounts very\nsuddenly dropped to having no customers during January 2006.\nOn August 29, 2006, the cousin of President Clinton's Press\nSecretary informed me that John Stossel of ABC's popular 20/20\nprogram was extremely impressed with my energy-related web-pages\nand Stossel had even already created a tentative name for a \"major\"\nsegment on me for 20/20, \"ONE MANS EFFORTS TO SAVE ON AMERICAS\nPOWER USAGE!\".  Amazingly quickly after receiving that\ne-mail, ABC News suddenly stopped all communication with me\n(which continues to this day six years later!)  I can't actually\nconnect that incident with anyone in the Village of Thornton,\nbut it was mighty peculiar that Stossel and 20/20 were incredibly\nenthusiastic about me one day, and from the next day on,\nit was as though I had leprosy or the Plague!  Dozens of\nrequests from me to people in ABC News, and also to Mr. McCurry,\nNEVER even received any responses after that, where we had been\nhaving daily communications prior to that.  WHATEVER the reason\nthat ABC News and (both) Mr. McCurrys instantly lost interest\nin me and my energy projects, I just wish I could know, and the\nONLY possibility that seems credible is that someone in Thornton\nspread their vicious lies about me to those fine people.  It\ncertainly was completely in line with seeing hundreds of people\nenjoying saving $200 each on sets of fireplace doors dropping\nsuddenly down to ONE customer over eight months!  So the ABC-\nStossel-20/20-McCurry incident is technically not in my list\nof confirmed actions by Thornton, like all the hundreds of\nother harassing behaviors which I have been able to confirm.<br><br>\n\nI certainly wonder WHAT sort of comments by any minor bureaucrat in a\ntiny Village could have said which might have caused National\norganizations and celebrities to change their attitudes toward me so\nseverely.  For the eight years before that (1998 to his death in 2006),\nmy dear friend Peter Jennings (Anchor of the Nightly News on\nABC News) certainly knew the quality of my existence, and it\nwas unfortunate that Peter died just a few months before he\nmight have defended me to whatever Stossel and the others were\napparently told about me!  But the way history happened, I wound\nup never knowing WHY I was suddenly eliminated from all contact\nwith ABC News ever again since September 2006.<br><br>\n\nAn AT&amp;T phone technician discovered an electronic device inside\ntheir gray box on the outside of my home (in 2008) which finally\nexplained why some neighbors had seen the Mayor's Secretary\nstand on the (public) sidewalk nearest that box, about every\nother day, over 700 different\ntimes (by the neighbor's estimate) over at least a period of four\nyears. (possibly longer, as there is no way to know how many years\nthat device had been in there, but the AT&amp;T Technician who found\nit was VERY angry as he thought that I had put it inside their\nequipment!)  The Mayor's Secretary would stand motionless on the\npublic sidewalk nearest that device, for about ten to fifteen\nminutes during the evening, about every other day for more than four\nyears, where she could download my phone calls and e-mail and internet,\nand also upload many thousands of incredibly nasty images into my\ncomputer.  I am still fuzzy at how anyone could do such things to\na TURNED OFF COMPUTER (while I was living in a different State for\ntwo or three weeks at a time!), but I guess Police have all sorts\nof toys.  The neighbor seemed bemused that the Mayor's Secretary\nwould stand there, motionless for ten or fifteen minutes, even in\nrainstorms, snowstorms and when the temperature was below zero!  Since\nthe neighbor's information told me that she always stood in the\nexact same location, in 2006, I installed a motion sensor and video camera\nand VCR aimed at that spot.  In a different situation, it would be a\ndarkly humorous scene to see the Date Stamps show the Mayor's Secretary\narrive about every second evening, and turn to face my house and stand\nrelatively motionless for around 10 or 12 minutes and then leave, only\nto see the video of the same behavior occur again over and over, either\ntwo or three days apart.  During the Summer of 2006, I recorded an\nentire six-hour VCR tape of repetitions of that behavior of hers.  But\nshe stayed on the public sidewalk, and at that time, I was not\naware of the electronic device she had installed in the phone equipment.\nStill, to see a video of any Mayor's Secretary spending six hours,\nin ten minute segments, for around the 32 times that I recorded\nher, is very bizarre.  When one considers that she repeated that\nover 700 times over more than four years, wow!  (I probably should\nhave uploaded that six hours of videotapes of her into my Internet\nDomain, or recorded her standing there during winter blizzards!)\nI wonder if that would have discouraged her from doing it or\nwhether she would have decided to use the assets of the Police Department\nto harass me even more.  (I did NOT ever record her dumpster-diving, going\nthrough my garbage container early on garbage mornings, which also might\nhave made interesting viewing regarding a Mayor's Secretary!)<br><br>\n\nOf course, at that time, during 2006, I was not yet aware of the\nelectronic device she had placed inside the telephone company's\nequipment on the side of my home, so I still just thought she was\nsimply harassing me along lines that she and a dozen other Thornton\nVillage employees and Thornton Police Officers often did.<br><br>\n\nDuring all of 2006, all of 2007 and the early part of 2008, I had\nnoticed that virtually every piece of postal mail I received,\nwith the exception of utility bills, had the envelope flap distinctly\nrippled.  I knew that when someone steamed open a letter to examine\nits contents, the water and heat causes the paper to expand, so\nthat when the letter was later re-glued, the flap showed such ripples.\nNO utility bill envelope ever had such ripples but virtually every\nother piece of mail I received did.  Actually, a skilled person CAN\nopen a letter without causing such ripples, but the employees of the\nThornton Village government apparently did not have that skill.\nWhen it had become so clear that my mail was being monitored and\nread (which I had understood to be a Federal Felony, interfering\nwith the mails), I even did three different experiments to verify\nthis.  Any Secretary knows that once a letter is folded, it is\nsupposed to be inserted into the envelope such that the letter falls\nopen by the reader.  But I intentionally inserted a typed letter\nUPSIDE DOWN in the envelope.  Not only that, but I bought a pair\nof surgical gloves to get the brand new sheet of blank paper and put it\nin the typewriter, and then to fold it and insert it into the\nenvelope.  In other words, I ensured that there were NO POSSIBLE\nFINGERPRINTS on the letter inside the envelope.  I made up a message\nregarding a possible interest in buying some product from me,\nas I had already learned that Thornton had a clear fascination\nwith anyone who might consider sending me any money.  And, on three\ndifferent dates, several weeks apart, early in 2006, I took such a\nletter to a nearby town and mailed it to my own address.<br><br>\n\nIn each case, it took either eight or nine days before the letter\nwas delivered (for a three mile trip in the mails!)  In each of the\nthree cases, the envelope flaps showed the usual ripples in the\npaper, which indicated that someone had steamed the letter open.\nWhen I opened the envelope, the letter was RIGHT SIDE UP, which\nconfirmed that someone had opened the envelope and removed the\nletter but they re-inserted it in the envelope in the NORMAL\nway and not upside-down as I had mailed it.  And finally, I used\na simple fingerprint kit and found around 15 fingerprints on each\nof the three letters, which each SHOULD HAVE BEEN pristinely\nfingerprint-free!  I actually now had ABSOLUTE PROOF that SOMEONE\nhad been violating Federal Law regarding opening private mail,\nAND I EVEN HAD FINGERPRINTS TO PROVE WHO IT WAS (the Mayor's\nSecretary, in all three cases).  Those fingerprints on those three\nletters exactly matched the fingerprints I had found on the soda\npop can and the vacuum cleaner inside my locked house four years\nearlier.<br><br>\n\nHowever, I realized that since I had NOT had any witnesses see\nme assemble any of the three letters, and no witnesses had seen\nthe ripples in the envelopes, and no witnesses had seen me\nopen any of those letters or seen me use the fingerprint kit,\nI knew that no Judge would consider any of that as actual\nevidence.  So even though I now had ABSOLUTE PROOF and even\nthe exact identity being the Mayor's Secretary, I knew that\nI did not have sufficient proof for a Court.  However, it DID seem\na moral victory to have gotten such impressive evidence from my\nthree experiments, and I finally eliminated any doubt regarding\nWHO was at the center of the harassment of me.<br><br>\n\nAs to HOW Village employees could get access to MY mail, it\nseems clear that someone in the local Post Office must have\nbeen involved.  The then Postmaster seemed regularly very nasty\nto me, and I have always assumed it was her, but with no proof.\nSeveral years later (in 2009) a very nice Postal Carrier remembered\nthat any mail to or from me was to be \"set aside\" but\nshe did not know why, or what happened to it.  But at least I\nstarted to understand why mail NEVER got to me in any\ntimely fashion, as it had up to the beginning of 2006, but that\nANY mail always then took at least eight days in transit.<br><br>\n\nBy the way, as a very thorough scientist, I also kept track of\nmail that I SENT to one specific friend.  To go from Illinois\nto Indiana, it always took around ten days (but that dropped to\nthe standard two days early in 2008, which I took as a confirmation\nthat Thornton might have finally decided to stop reading my mail!).\nMy friend knew that I would intentionally insert the letters\nupside-down, but he always confirmed that they arrived right-side-up.\nI was never able to get him to buy a fingerprint kit, so he never\nchecked whether there were any fingerprints on letters where there\ncould not have been any.  After mid-2008, my mail, both inbound and\noutbound, seemed to no longer have ripples in the envelopes and\nit arrived in the correct timely intervals.<br><br>\n\n One more bizarre incident apparently regarding their aggressive\n intention of having my house Condemned and Demolished during 2003.\n It seems clear that the Village employees must have felt that they\n saw some reason INSIDE my house which they wanted to add to their\n claims of having it destroyed, but they could not easily admit to\n knowing such things without also admitting that they had broken\n into my locked house!  So one day when I was hosting three men\n neighbors in our daily horseshoe games, a white pickup truck\n showed up and stopped near one of the other players, to offer him\n a job as a laborer.  We all thought it was peculiar that anyone\n would drive up to a total stranger and offer a job, but he went to work\n the next morning.  He later was laughing when he mentioned to the\n others of us that the guy who had hired him (the husband of Karen\n Leoni, the part-time Secretary who seems to be involved in many\n of these things) spent the ENTIRE 20 minutes of the morning break\n time in asking him dozens of questions ABOUT THE INTERIOR OF MY\n HOUSE!  It turned out that Louie had never been inside my house\n and had no way of knowing what it was like.  At noon, he was either\n fired or laid off, so his new job as laborer only lasted half of\n one day!  And central in that half-day were all the questions about the\n interior of my house!  There may not actually have been anything\n illegal there, but it sure seems peculiar!  At a time when they\n were going through my house whenever I was not around, and while they\n had already tried four times in six months to Condemn and Demolish\n my house, it just seems VERY strange that Louie was hired by a\n total stranger, only to be interrogated regarding my house, and then\n dumped without even getting a full day's pay!<br><br>\n\nThe Village of Thornton, Illinois spent all those years and\nseveral thousands of hours of effort to try to\ndestroy a Christian Minister!  The anecdotes mentioned here are\nonly a tiny part of their entire set of behaviors toward me\n(which is even still continuing into 2014 as I am updating this text).\nEven I find that amazing and unbelievable,\nexcept since they did it to <b>ME</b>, and my training as a Research Scientist,\ncaused me to very carefully collect and document massive amounts of evidence.\nThey actually did FAR more than these core activities, such as Stalking\nme into other towns and then trying to get those towns to arrest me for\ncrazy crimes, and endless harassment.  The linked web-pages present the\nevidence of many of those hundreds of different events.  Not being\na Lawyer, I don't know for sure, but many of their behaviors,\nby at least a dozen different individuals, seem rather criminal.<br><br>\n\nAnd it all continues!  Even after nine years of this harassment,\nthe Village Code Enforcement Officer, named Torres, overheard a\nconversation regarding why a neighbor who owns a riding mower\nsometimes mowed my grass in 2011.  Torres approached the neighbor,\nand instead of expressing praise for a neighbor helping an elderly\nand medically frail neighbor, Torres apparently went into a\nrant severely criticizing my neighbor for helping, and also adding\nin some amazingly insulting comments regarding MY character!<br><br>\n\nI had only ever first met Mr. Torres in June of 2009, when he and\nothers knocked on my door to inform me that they were about to\nhave ALL the trees on my property chopped down.  As I opened the\ndoor, to meet for the first time someone I had never met or talked\nto before, I thought it was appropriate to introduce myself!\nIMMEDIATELY after I mentioned that I am a Christian Pastor,\nTorres blurted out \"<b>No you aren't</b>\" which was\nquite a shock to hear!  A moment later he said \"You claim\nto be part of a Church?  I will take care of THAT!\" in\nan incredibly threatening tone.  This was the FIRST CONVERSATION\nwe ever had!  He also ANNOUNCED that I had NOT replaced the entire roof\nof the house in 2003 after I mentioned that I had (which he had to see\nwas a FINE job well done).  And his attitude toward me has\ncertainly not improved, but gone seriously downhill since!  One time\nwhen I had mowed 89% of my rather large lawn, when an unusual part\ninside my very old Toro lawnmower broke, and I had to wait for Toro\nto send me a replacement part, Torres found the 11% that had not yet\nbeen mowed.  Did he knock on the door to ASK why I had mowed nearly\nall of the lawn but not all?  No!  Did he issue any kind of Warning\nregarding tall grass?  No!  He issued a VIOLATION which instructed\nme to either mail in the fine or carry it in to their Village Office!\n(It turns out he was not allowed to do that without a prior Warning).\nAnd did he put that Violation in my mail or on my doorknob or anywhere\nwhere I might find it?  No.  He decided to TAPE IT TO THE GLASS of\none of the 48 windows of the large house, where I did not even find\nit for several days!<br><br>\n\nThe Village of Thornton Municipal employees and their local Police\nOfficers have been told so often and for so long the lies they\nmade up about me in 2002, that it all never ends!<br><br>\n\nDoesn't it seem more likely that they might have decided to go after\nsomeone they KNEW about, that was actually even FROM their town?\nMaybe even someone they knew had some kind of criminal record?\nBut they clearly wanted to find some target to try to distract\nthe trouble that their Fire Chief was in, and this all happened\nonly shortly after George W. Bush passed his Patriot Act.  There is\nevery indication that Thornton interpreted the Patriot Act as\nabsolute freedom to ignore all Laws and even the Constitution, as\nnothing they could ever do could ever be wrong!  (That is my best\nguess as to WHY they started this and doggedly pursue it all against\nme.  Since none of them have ever even talked to me, I do not see\nhow I could have ever offended anyone, but Ministers rarely offend\npeople anyway!<br><br>\n\nThis is all rather amazing that they happened to pick a target where\nthe entire rest of the world calls and e-mails me to ask for solutions\nto serious problems (evidenced by the assorted web-pages in this Domain\nof mine).  Thornton seemed to not like that either, as they were quite\nactive in both monitoring my e-mail and even sending their own e-mails\nout to people who had just been in contact with me.  Such people never\ncommunicated with me again!  Since by monitoring my communication, the\nVillage already had the sending e-mail address or calling phone number\nof such people, they were able to immediately contact those people (who\nhad respected me up to then!) to spread their old lies to people all over\nthe world.  Quite an impressive effort!<br><br>\n\n<b>Interestingly, the actions of the Village of Thornton have enabled me\nto get a far better insight of what had been done to Jesus!</b>  Like everyone\nelse, I had already read the words in the Bible where the Jews had loved\nand admired Jesus just weeks earlier, but then they turned on Him and\nit was THEIR decision that Jesus be Crucified.  Well, having lived\nthrough these past eight years of Thornton's behaviors, where EVERY\nneighbor has heard their lies (for the Police would NEVER lie, right?) so\nrepeatedly that they each and every one have deep and profound hatred\nof me now.  A <b>MINISTER</b> who has never been in trouble beyond a few\nParking Tickets and has been an admired Christian Minister since 1996!<br><br>\n\nI often wonder how effective Thornton is when their target is actually\na bad person or who has actually been in trouble!  Targets who would never\nhave even the tiniest chance of trying to defend themselves (as\nmy evidence and web-pages try to do regarding me).<br><br>\n\nI am not a Lawyer, but my understanding of our Constitution is\nthat we Citizens are supposed to have Civil Rights, and that\npeople like Police and government (which WE pay for) are supposed\nto be Civil Servants.  How does Thornton, Illinois think that their\nMonarchy behaviors are compatible with the Constitution?\nSpecifically, as I read the Fourth Amendment, we Citizens are supposed\nto be safe from improper searches and seizures, but in Thornton,\nANY employee of the government is free to ENTER any house or\nbuilding, as long as they do not have to break any doors or\nwindows to do that.  Isn't there something wrong there?<br><br>\n\nAre they really ALLOWED to pro-actively and preemptively destroy\nthe career and life of ANYONE?  In America?  It seems they are!<br><br>\n\nWhat would YOUR attitude be if whenever you were at work or otherwise\naway, Secretaries (and possibly even Janitors!) would feel free to\nenter your (LOCKED) house and wander around in it?  I eventually had\nto buy and install a Home Security System, NOT due to any criminals\nbut due to trying to keep the VILLAGE and POLICE out of my house!\n<b>This IS America, right?</b><br><br>\n\nOnce I started realizing in 2002 and 2003, that Thornton felt free to\nenter my locked house whenever they wished, and all the phone\nand internet monitoring they constantly did, and I still lived\n60 miles away in Indiana, I used my creativity to try to\nexpand the capability of that home security system to defend my house\nfrom the Village of Thornton.  Each time I left for the three weeks, I\nmade sure to leave either one or two old TVs on 24 hours every day, nice and\nloud, and I placed them so that the light from the flashing TV screens would light\nup walls and some window drapes.  I left an old car parked outside there, even\nthough the empty garage was available.  I set up a couple shadow-makers in front\nof some windows, back-lit by the TV sets, so that moving shadows would be\nseen from outside as though people were inside.  And I set up software so\nthat one rather old computer was automatically turned on several times\neach day and then onto the Internet, where it would randomly\ngo to assorted web-sites, during the usual three-week intervals\nthat I was away from the house.  I figured that if they were going to\ngo to the trouble of monitoring and reviewing the internet activity\n(of the Church computer!) inside the house, I would create as much fake\ntraffic as possible, to keep them REALLY occupied!  I wanted Thornton to\nTHINK that I was IN the house, to discourage their penchant for entering\nthe locked house (again) when they thought I was NOT around.  Those\nefforts on my part apparently convinced them, as later odd experiences\nincluded rather vicious criticism for me not answering the door\nwhen a Thornton official wanted to tell me some demands!  Even though I was\nfar off in a different State, HE yelled at me for not answering the door! That\npretty much confirmed their constant attempts of monitoring my\nactivities, as well as their incompetence in actually doing it,\nas they made comments which clearly concluded that I was always there!\nThey seemed to have no idea that I was RARELY there, generally living\nIN A DIFFERENT STATE sixty miles away!  It was a lot of trouble to\nhave to do all of that, but it seemed to have worked as there\nhas not been any indication that they have again entered my\nlocked and generally vacant house.  I suppose that if they DID\nget in again, they would have seen that the house has essentially\nNO furniture or even a kitchen table, and they might then\nhave realized that no one was living in the house!  Sort\nof darkly funny!<br><br>\n\nAn interesting future possibility seems likely.  At some point,\nthe world figures to realize that one or more of my energy\ninventions will be worth using for the benefit of millions of people.  I would think\nthat situation will force people to try to finally decide whether\nthe lies that Thornton made up and still repeats are true or not.  The simplest\nresearch will show that I have NEVER been in any trouble beyond a\ncouple Parking Tickets in a lifetime of driving.  But there WILL then\nbe over a thousand people who can confirm that Thornton repeatedly\ntold them the same lies for at least eight years.  I am not sure how\nThornton will be able to deny having made up and spread those lies\nthen!  <b>But since the Federal government has passed laws where\nMunicipal governments and Police Departments cannot\nbe charged with any crimes</b>, they will obviously never get in any\nactual trouble for having destroyed my life!  Ah, America!<br><br>\n\nNow, I realize that this entry seems to be a very bizarre one in the\ncollection of the pages in this Domain.  Why is it in here?  Well,\nif you think about it, you might see!  Thornton seems to be persistent\nif nothing else.  For ten years, they have tried to damage me in\nevery imaginable way, specifically apparently trying to set me up to\nseem to be guilty of crimes which were never true. (I found\nfingerprints of the Mayor's Secretary inside my locked house,\ntwice, in 2002; which made more sense in May 2003 when the Mayor\nhappened to casually mention to me on the phone that any Village\nemployee was free to enter any house or building in the Village;\nmany times when I would make the hour drive to cut the grass,\nI would usually discover as many as 7,000 photographic images\nin my locked house and on my shut-off computer, where I cannot\neven imagine the total number of such nasty photos that the\nVillage had somehow inserted into my computer;\nthen at least from 2004 to 2008, that same Mayor's Secretary\nstood for twelve to fifteen minutes about every second day,\nor at least 700 times; where in 2008, a phone company technician\nfound a small shiny electronic device inside of their phone\nequipment. So during 2007 and then certainly in 2008, I realized\nwhat enormous danger I was probably in. By then, they had\napparently spent thousands of hours in trying to make it seem\nthat instead of being a quiet Minister, I was some sort of\nevil person. They certainly worked at setting that up\namazingly thoroughly, for about five years at that time.\nSo I started to suspect that they planned to have a SWAT\nTeam break into my house, where they expected to find all the\nnasty photos they had inserted into my computer. I thought about\nwhether there would be any way for me to defend against such\nclaims, but it seemed clear that they spent those five years\nin setting that up where I probably would not be able to\npresent any defense. And so I realized that I HAD TO collect\nall my evidence regarding the many hundreds of amazing things\nthey have done, and uploaded the file (or files as it turned out)\ninto my Domain of mostly religious information.  So each\nday since about mid-2007, I have expected to see all the Village's\nPolice Cars fill my dead-end street to haul me away.  The fact\nthat THEY somehow apparently used my computer to collect\nnasty photos (that I guess a Police Department probably had\ncollected) would certainly have made it LOOK like I was\nguilty of everything they might try to claim against me.\nMy thinking is that at some point, I would be brought before\na Judge, and I thought that providing the link to the page,\nor even getting an Attorney to print out all eighty\npages of my evidence, dated in 2007, might get a Judge to see\nthat things were not as he was told by them.  Actually,\nI have a second reason for including these comments about\nthe very bad behavior of Thornton, where someone in the Village\nmight have found this information by now.  My reasoning is that\nthey might see it as very foolish to now send in their SWAT\nTeam, when they must now know that the Judge would see the\ntruth of these past ten years in the 2007 web-page information.\nIn any case, so far they have not broken into my house or\nsent their SWAT team. Actually, many of the Police Officers\nand the Village employees who were in this in 2002 have\neither retired or transferred elsewhere, so maybe there are\nfew remaining that would be gung-ho about increasing their\nharassment of me again.<br><br>\n\nSince they seem likely\nto continue those efforts, I have to assume that some day they will\nbreak into my house and \"find\" evidence which they will have\nplaced there.  I recognize that no one would then believe me to be\ninnocent, since they have not believed me for the past eight years,\nso whatever alleged \"evidence\" they will have had\nplaced in my house or in my computer or whatever, will be seen as\nvalid.  Well, now that this (2007) historical record of the evidences\nof their previous activities has been on the Internet for several years,\nI am hoping that some Judge might realize that THEY had done some\nthings wrong and not me!  I am a pretty smart person, but I have\nnot thought of any way to try to handle a SWAT Team attack on my\nhouse other than this one.  IF a better response some day occurs to me,\nI would really much prefer NOT to have these bizarre matters in my\notherwise high-class web-site!<br><br>\n\nOh, they have done a LOT of things over ten years, and I am a VERY\ngood research scientist, so I have documented MANY different of their\nactivities, so that web-page (linked above) would print out to around\n80 pages!  So you probably do NOT want to print it out, and probably\ndo not even want to read it all!<br><br>\n\nOf course, I have no way of knowing what other methods of\nharassment they have done to me over these years. It seems likely\nthat they probably used their fictitious evidence to get my name\nput on any of hundreds of Government Watch-lists of supposedly\ndangerous people. Peculiarly, even an Officer friend of mine\n(of 25 years and from another State) could apparently not\naccess such lists, so there is apparently no way that I could\never know whether they put my name on such lists, or even\nhow many such lists. Apparently, it used to be that ANY\nPolice Department could anonymously add names to Government\nWatch-lists, which suggests that if they got my name put\n(permanently and forever) on such lists, there would apparently\nbe no reference to who added my name or when!  Cute, huh?<br><br>\n\nOne final matter remains.  Friends have long told me to sell\nthe house and move away, to have some peace, and possibly even\nagain be able to perform as a Christian Pastor.  I see some things\nwrong with that.  First, it would be CONCEDING TO THEM and ENCOURAGING\nTHEM TO KEEP BEHAVING THAT WAY, possibly to countless others who\nmight not be able to defend themselves as well as a lily-white\nChristian Minister might.  Second, it terrifies me to think of\nhow they must harass residents of Thornton who DO have criminal\nrecords, or otherwise might be seen as deserving the treatment\nthey have dumped on me.  Third, recognizing that NO ONE is allowed\nto ever file any Lawsuit against any Municipal government or against\nany local Police Department, they clearly must feel quite comfortable\nin having behaved in such offensive and illegal ways for these\npast ten years or more.  I guess I am conceding that I have no\npossible way of ever getting any of them Arrested or ever paying\nany Judgment for having destroyed my career as both a Christian\nMinister and as a Nuclear Physicist, but this information on\nthe Internet MIGHT come to the attention of someone who was\nconsidering buying a house in Thornton, Illinois, where they\nmight have second thoughts.  That is not quite as good as having\nthose mis-behaving Public Servants arrested where they might pay for\ntheir conduct, but if they have fewer potential victims in the\nfuture, that seems the best I can hope for.  NOTHING is going\nto stop them from having the attitudes and the arrogance they have.<br><br>\n\n  </li><li><b><a href=\"public3/thornto2.html\">Amazing Bad Behavior of the Village of Thornton, Illinois, Part 2</a></b>\n  </li><li><b><a href=\"public3/thornto3.html\">Amazing Bad Behavior of the Village of Thornton, Illinois, Part 3</a></b>\n</li></ul>\n<p>\n\n\n\n</p><div id=\"dot0\" style=\"HEIGHT: 25;

That location was selected as being very distant\nfrom any human activities or factories and also from any\nvegetation growth or activity.  It was felt that measurements\nat the South Pole would be accurate indications of the true\ncondition of the Earth's atmosphere.<p>\n\nAt bi-weekly intervals, air samples are collected in sets of three\n5-liter evacuated glass flasks, at the South Pole (Lat. 89°59'S. Long.\n24°48'W.).  They are analyzed for CO<sub>2</sub> at SIO (Scripps)\nusing a nondispersive infrared gas analyzer with a water vapor freeze\ntrap.  Calibration gases are regularly tested as well to confirm\naccuracy.  The three sample flasks must agree within 0.40 ppmv to\nbe considered acceptable data.  Scripps has more thorough description\nof their procedures and equipment.</p><p>\n\nThe readings are averaged to obtain monthly and annual average values.\nOur running display uses the annual averaged figures from this South Pole\ndata, interpolated for each 1/10 second.</p><p>\n\nIf the specific interpolated value at the South Pole for an instant\nwere 380.0 ppmv, this means that the atmosphere was then 0.000380\ncarbon dioxide (by volume).  It is accurately known that the total\nEarth's atmosphere is 5.136 * 10<sup>15</sup> metric tonnes.\nIt is also necessary to apply a density factor of 1.529 (of carbon\ndioxide to the average atmospheric mixture of gases) to convert\nthe ppm (volume) value to ppm (mass or weight).</p><p>\n\n<b>Therefore, it is simply necessary to multiply these three numbers\n5.136 * 10<sup>15</sup> * 0.000380 * 1.529 to get 2984.12 billion\ntonnes of carbon dioxide in the entire Earth's atmosphere at that\ninstant.</b>  THIS is the value that is continuously displayed here.\nThe value has NOTHING to do with actual usage or consumption\nfigures of fossil fuels, which actually generally give larger\nnumbers for the annual increases.</p><p>\n\nWhat about the accuracy of those three numbers that we have to\nmultiply?  The density of carbon dioxide?  No problem there.\nExtremely accurately known.\nThe measurements of the air at the South Pole?  Three identical\nflasks, and when analyzed, they have to have extremely similar\nvalues to be considered acceptable.  Ah HA!  You think that the\nmass of air in the atmosphere might be off.  Well, YOU can confirm\nit!  A Barometer measures the air pressure, right?  And you might\naccept that it is usually around 14.7 pounds per square inch.\nDo you realize what that number actually means?  It means that if\nyou somehow marked out a column of air, one inch by one inch, all the\nway from the ground to the top of the atmosphere (outer space), that\nair weighs a total of 14.7 pounds!  Cool, huh?  So now, all you have\nto do is look up in some book what the total surface area of the Earth\nis (in square miles) and convert that to square inches, and multiply by\n14.7, to find the exact total weight of the entire Earth's atmosphere\n(in pounds).  So all three of the numbers are really reliably accurate.</p><p>\n\nIn case you don't want to have to do this math, you already know that\natmospheric pressure (at sea level) is 14.696 pounds per square inch\n(or 10332.3 kilograms per square meter).  We multiply this\n(metric) number by the total area of the surface of the earth, which is\n5.10101 * 10<sup>14</sup> square meters.  So YOU can calculate that the\ntotal mass of the Earth's atmosphere is 5.270 * 10<sup>18</sup> kg\nor 5.270 * 10<sup>15</sup> metric tons.  For purists, the actual total\nmass is slightly less because continents and mountains take up\nsome volume where air might otherwise be, the 5.136 * 10<sup>15</sup>\nmetric tonnes used above.  (So YOUR answer is actually a couple\npercent wrong, high!)</p><p>\n\n<b>(Published Data)</b></p><p>\n\nAtmospheric CO2 concentrations (ppmv) derived from flask and in situ air\nsamples collected at the South Pole</p><p>\n \nSource: C.D.

Beginning around 1990, I tried\nto get people to realize that there were bad implications of the fact that\nnearly everyone was already living beyond their means, primarily due to the\nmassive use of credit cards.  No one seemed to accept that SOME DAY they\nwould have to pay for all those things they were buying and enjoying then!\nAs the (alleged) value of houses kept increasing, AND that banks were\nwilling to give amazingly large loans on all houses, many millions of\npeople started considering their homes to be piggy banks, providing\neven more money to spend.  No one seemed to ever even consider that\nhome values might drop to a more realistic level.<p>\n\nPeople blame ALL of our financial problems on Banks that gave home\nloans to millions of people who could not possibly have afforded the\nhomes they wanted to buy.  Yes, the Banks have some responsibility, but\nthe PEOPLE who KNOWINGLY were agreeing to get such loans that they\nknew that they would never be able to pay off were probably even more\nguilty.  There was also a common mindset that ANYONE could buy ANY (expensive)\nhouse and immediately sell it for $50,000 more than it was bought for,\nwhich APPEARED to create $50,000 cash for the person who\n\"flipped\" the house.</p><p>\n\nDuring the 1990s, I often described America as having a network of\nincredibly tightly strung violin strings, where if ANY of them would\nbreak, then EVERYTHING would come apart.</p><p>\n\nI sometimes described an \"island economy\" where one person\nmowed lawns and another cut hair and a third made shoes.  They charged\neach other exactly one dollar, and all three were happy!  But over many\nyears, they all felt they were not being properly rewarded and they\neach raised their prices many time.  Now, they charge each other\n$1,000 to mow the lawn, $1,000 for a haircut and $1,000 for a pair of\nshoes.  They are all happy.  Are they any better off than at the start?\nThere is no REALITY to those increases, and the fact that they all\nmade the same increases caused there to be no actual effects at all.\nBut now they each have a pile of money to count, which seems to make\nthem feel happy.  They seem willing to overlook that a loaf of bread\nwhich used to cost 25 cents now costs each of them $250!  And they all\ndescribe themselves as prosperous!  (They are actually wrong about that!)</p><p>\n\nI have noticed that the \"experts\" today are all telling everyone\nto pay off their credit card debts.  That certainly is correct guidance,\nbut there are TWO huge problems!  The first is that few people have\nthe money around to be ABLE to pay them off or even pay them down!\nThe second problem is even worse, and no one seems to ever mention it!\nThe whole ATTRACTION of credit cards (say, ten years ago) was to be\nable to have and use products that they knew they could not possibly\nafford!  In other words, GETTING and USING attractive products.  The\nexperts today are expecting people to have absolutely reversed that\nbasic characteristic of human nature!  They expect people today to\nPAY FOR PRODUCTS THEY USED TEN YEARS AGO!  Which means that they would\nthereby guarantee that there was NO chance that they would ever be\nable to get to use MODERN products!  Not with credit cards, because\nthey are no longer allowed to.  Not with cash, because they would\nbe using up any available cash TO PAY FOR THOSE ANCIENT PLEASURES!</p><p>\n\nSo, among the other catastrophes that we are starting to encounter,\na really huge 900-pound gorilla in the room is the fact that the very\nPOSSIBILITY of using credit cards in the future is somewhat unlikely at\nall.  Concurrently, people today figure to be unable and unwilling\nto buy new things with actual cash, meaning that nearly all markets\nfigure to dry up nearly completely.  So, in addition to the problem that\nmany businesses will soon lay off millions of people in order to\nsurvive as businesses (by reducing expenses), that problem for the\nbusinesses will be multiplied by the fact that there figure to be\nextremely few customers for their products and services.  It is\nhard to see how ANY businesses will be able to survive this compound\nproblem.</p><p>\n\nThe MAJORITY of American families have absolutely no idea how\nto live today without being able to put a lot of debt into the distant\nfuture on credit cards.  It is hard to see how long that learning\ncurve will take before they are again able to live within their\nown means.  Considering that many millions will soon not have jobs\nat all, their level of \"means\" figures to be very low\nindeed.</p><p>\n\n</p><hr>\n\nDuring 2004, I told a number of people that I thought that in either\n2008 or 2009, the Stock Market would drop to below 6,000.  Everyone\nlaughed at my ignorance!  When it passed 14,000 during 2008, I was\nseen as an idiot.  I admit that it only dropped to around 8,000 during\n2009, but I was fairly close!<p>\n\nBut this will get FAR worse!.  There is little doubt that by the\nSummer of 2009, people will be TALKING about similarities to the Great\nDepression of the 1930s.  But it seems likely that around then, millions of\npeople who lost their jobs will be defaulting on their credit card\npayments, and VISA and MasterCard (and Banks) will get hurt to a level that\nthe current (2008) Wall Street crisis may seem minor!  Among other things,\nall the people who now use credit cards to survive, may then be denied\nthat ability, but the government will likely need to print up\nseveral trillion additional dollars to solve that problem.</p><p>\n\nThere will be so many problems which are EACH unimaginably huge,\nthat it is hard to see how even the US government will be able to\nafford to throw enough money at all the problems to try to solve\nthem.  So I believe that by about 2011 or 2012, the entire financial\nsituation in the US may seem absolutely hopeless.  It seems certain\nthat the almighty dollar will necessarily be devaluated, maybe\nto about half of its current value.  So IF any people actually\nhad any cash (or stocks), it would suddenly be worth half as much.</p><p>\n\nIt is hard to see how the situation in the US could significantly\nimprove even by 2020.  So the situation may be similar to but\neven worse than the Great Depression.  One reason it seems likely\nto be worse is that in the 1930s, there were only MEN competing for\nthe few (manual labor) jobs, where now the work force is nearly twice\nas large because of the fact that women are also working.  And since\nthe US enthusiastically passed NAFTA and GATT in the early 1990s,\nthere are essentially NO high-paying manufacturing jobs still\nremaining in the US.  Where will the jobs be, for possibly\n50 million unemployed Americans who will all be on the verge\nof starvation, without any home or apartment, and possibly even without\nany motor vehicles?</p><p>\n\nA really troubling aspect of this is the immense number of handguns\nin the US, MORE than the number of people!  Say that YOUR family\nscrimps and saves and you will actually be able to have enough\nmoney to buy food to eat.  Your neighbors will all know that,\nespecially all of those who do not have jobs and do not have any\nmoney or even an apartment.  But they will certainly have many handguns.\nDoesn't it figure that at some point, they will figure it out?  That,\nin total desperation and starvation, they will walk up to YOUR door\nand demand your food and money.  They will get it.  The only real\nquestion will be whether any of your family will still be alive.\nAnd Police will be of no use, as EVERY community will have such events\nhappening every day, and there are not nearly enough Police even now.</p><p>\n\nEven though the Global Warming catastrophe will certainly be far\nworse, at least it figures to be a number of decades away, while these\neconomic problems seem likely to begin seriously in 2009 and CONTINUE\nfor at least ten years.  Sadly, everyone will become so focused on\neconomic problems that environmental issues may be neglected.  However,\nBECAUSE of the extreme severity of the coming economic problems,\nat least there can be a dark benefit that far fewer people will be\nable to be using up gasoline and diesel and Jet-fuel in wasteful vehicles.</p><p>\n\nAdditional note of June 2009:  It is really troubling to me that\nour leaders seem to often have incomplete logic behind their concepts!\nAn excellent example is the Chrysler bailout.  Rather than letting\nChrysler totally fail and it assets sold off to pay for some debts,\nthe Federal Government decided that would be too disruptive to the\nweak economy, so they did some tricky things to supposedly enable\nChrysler to continue.  They got Fiat to agree to take over Chrysler's\noperation by giving Fiat 6 billion dollars, and even then Fiat knew\nthat it was a bad idea!  Chrysler went into bankruptcy, which has\nalways taken at least five months in the Courts in the past, but through\nsome trickery, Chrysler was declared out of bankruptcy in a month!\nThat would be wonderful if that thinking was complete!  But it is not!</p><p>\n\nThe vehicles that Fiat makes in Italy cannot be sold in the US, due to\nour many Federal Regulations.  Everyone agrees that it would be at least\nTWO FULL YEARS before Fiat could ever start building (small) cars in the\nUS that could be sold here.  A recent news report announced that\nFiat/Chrysler would be able to START making economy cars around December\n2011.  See the problem?  Our government rushed through Chrysler's\nbankruptcy process, hurting some investors in the process, with the\napparent intention of getting Chrysler back into operation manufacturing\ncars in the US, thereby re-employing all those thousands of workers who\nlost their jobs in the Bankruptcy.  The PROBLEM is: So you put them\nall back in the factories, but WHAT DO THEY BUILD?  The factories are NOT\nset up to build the little Fiats which can be sold in Europe, so they\ncannot do that.  For two years, they will not be able to even START\nbuilding the alleged future Chrysler cars which are tiny and efficient.\n\nThe ONLY vehicles that they are set up to build are essentially\nOBSOLETE!  The giant gas-hogs which made most of Chrysler's profits\nfor many years, but which no one will now buy.  And if no one would\nbuy them before the Bankruptcy, even fewer would buy them from a\ncompany that seemed clearly to simply be \"making work\"\nfor those thousands of workers!  So unless the Federal Government\nis willing to buy decks of cards for all those thousands of alleged\nChrysler employees to occupy their time with for the next two years,\nwhat else are they going to do?  And no one can expect Fiat to be\nspending billions of dollars for that sort of activity, as they are\nfully occupied in just making and selling their Fiats in Europe!</p><p>\n\nHow can anyone expect that Fiat will be willing to wait for more\nthan two years before re-activating the American factories?\nHow can anyone expect the American workers to wait for more than\ntwo years to get jobs back in uncertain factories?  And why would\nanyone believe that millions of customers would jump to buy totally\nuntested vehicles beyond two years from now, where much of any\nprofits that occurred would certainly go to Italy and Fiat Corporate?</p><p>\n\nWith such a poorly thought-through plan, Chrysler is certainly toast.\nThe American public is already upset in paying so many billions of\ndollars to keep Chrysler and GM afloat so far, and that purse will\ncertainly soon dry up.  And leaders will then FINALLY face the\nunavoidable fact that Chrysler assets will start getting hauled away\nto Italy!  Those assets cannot then even be sold to try to pay off\nany debts, since Fiat was given full control of them!</p><p>\n\n</p><hr>\n\nAnother update, of November 2009:  Chrysler's problems are compounding,\nwhere they announced that their sales dropped about 35% to 40%\nlast month.  The Chrysler Execs finally announced that they recognize\nthat no one wants to buy the giant gas-hogs they have still been\nmanufacturing, and they now intent to START planning to make smaller\ncars within a few years.  Chrysler will never be around that long!\nI am convinced that the really talented guy from Fiat will give up\non this experiment of trying to save Chrysler, maybe around February\n1, 2010.  Whatever day he flies back to Italy, the next day, Chrysler\nwill disintegrate completely.<p>\n\nBut there is a FAR more important fact is recent news.  A year ago,\ngold was selling for about $800 per ounce.  Yesterday, they announced\nthat it had exceeded $1500 per ounce.  No one seems willing to explain\nto the public just what that means, and it is REALLY bad and REALLY\nurgent.</p><p>\n\nGold does not actually increase or decrease in value very much, because\nthe world's supply of it is relatively constant.  When gold APPEARS\nto double in cost in some type of currency, <b>the REALITY is that\nTHAT CURRENCY had DROPPED TO HALF ITS VALUE.</b></p><p>\n\nGovernment and leaders do NOT want people to realize this fact.  If\nand when the public realizes this, absolute financial anarchy seems\nvery likely.  Why?  Because, at some point, Geitner or Obama will have\nto appear on National TV and announce that the (almighty) dollar is\nbeing DEVALUED to maybe half its previous value.  At that moment,\nyour paycheck will remain as many DOLLARS as before, but it will\nbe able to BUY only half what it did yesterday.  If you think that\nmillions of people are NOW on the verge of bankruptcy and ruin, imagine\nhow much worse it will become that day when everyone's INCOME\nsuddenly only had half the remaining value.  STORES will immediately\ndouble all prices of all products, in order to be as profitable and\nstable as they were the day before.  But customers would now have to\npay $400 for groceries rather than $200 the day before.</p><p>\n\nThis means that SAVINGS, PENSIONS, etc, will suddenly have half the\nworth as the day before.  Everyone will soon have to live day-to-day\nin real-time, in order to get paid at the increasing rates that\nwill be necessary to keep up with the increasing prices of all needed\nproducts.</p><p>\n\nImagine how many fur coats will then be sold?  Or luxury vacations on\nyachts?  Or nearly anything beyond simply the needs of basic survival.</p><p>\n\nHow did this happen?  Well, historians will argue that for decades.\nIt probably was NECESSARY for Bush and Obama and their Administrations\nto print trillions of dollars of new money to be able to give\nastounding amounts of money to the banks to avoid the entire economy\nfalling off a cliff.  The leaders were all familiar with the Great\nDepression of the 1930s and they felt it necessary to try to do those\nthings to avoid repeating the Great Depression.  In that, they seemed\nto succeed.  However, the fact that they had to print up all that\nextra paper money, while the actual total value of all money was\ncertainly not increasing at all, and it might have decreased, set\nin motion the process toward devaluation of the dollar.</p><p>\n\nThe leaders all HOPED that the consequences would not occur.\nThe assumptions were that if they could get all markets to become\nreally profitable, then there would become widespread prosperity and\neveryone would be happy and secure.  There seems that there was\na horrible flaw in that logic, in not seriously considering the\nalternatives.  Personally, I have a suspicion that it MIGHT have\nactually been BETTER in the long run if they had simply stood back\nand LET the banks fail and the American economic system fall into a\ndeep Depression, probably even worse than that in the 1930s.</p><p>\n\nBecause what figures to happen now seems certain to be far worse.\nThe wild and rapid increases in the value of gold, seems CERTAIN to\nforce the hand of American government leadership, specifically\nGeitner and Obama, to greatly devaluate the dollar.  This has NEVER\nhappened before to America!  But when it has happened to other countries,\nit has often led to a downward spiral that is self-perpetuating.\nWhich suggests that further devaluations will then occur.  One really\nbad part of this is that it can happen VERY fast.  In just months,\ngasoline might be $100 per gallon or more.  A loaf of bread might be\n$5 or $20 or more.  And NO ONE will be immune from the effects.</p><p>\n\nAnyone who DID own any assets or money, would/will use it all up\nrather fast.  And since there will be few customers for any products,\nhow many businesses could survive?  Meaning, how many jobs?</p><p>\n\nOne of the reasons for the downward spiral is that governments tend\nto start printing more and more money, to try to give out enough for\npeople to be happy with.  But the printing of trillions of dollars\nof extra money merely causes more devaluation in its value, and nothing\nactually changes.</p><p>\n\nThe US government will certainly TRY to keep increasing Social\nSecurity payments and Food Stamps, and making sure that military and\npolice are paid.  But that is likely to only be temporary solutions.</p><p>\n\nWhen we did not go off a cliff at the end of 2008, by very creative\nideas, the long term effect might have been that we will soon face\na far taller cliff which we WILL fall off of.  And the sorts of desperate\nmeasures that are generally applied in trying to reduce the bad effects,\nvirtually always actually have the effect of making the cliff taller.</p><p>\n\nUntil this recent gold news, I thought it would be around 2012 or 2013\nbefore we got to the very darkest part of the economic catastrophe that\nwe are now in.  I now wonder if that cliff might be just a month or two\naway, near the very start of 2010.  And it is really hard to see how\nanyone will be able to survive very well, and certainly NO ONE will\nprosper.</p><p>\n\nI feel the need for an addition to these dark comments early in 2016.\nSaudi Arabia leaders do NOT want 28 pages of the 2001 attack documents to\nget released, because they apparently show that Saudi Royal Family members\nwere somehow involved in the 9/11/01 attacks, possibly due to financially\nsupporting the terrorists then.  NOW, with the threat that the US\ngovernment is talking about RELEASING those 28 pages of old files, the\nSaudi government has threatened the US with their intention of SELLING\neverything they own in the US.  It's around a total of $750 billion\ndollars, mostly of Real Estate and Financial documents.  This WILL be\nhorrific if they actually SELL all that stuff!  Why?  Because the ACTUAL\nTOTAL AMOUNT OF ACTUAL REAL US MONEY is only around $260 billion dollars.\nYes, TOTAL DEBTS in the US are around $60 trillion dollars, but the\nproblem is that virtually all of that is based on \"imaginary money\", that \nis money that had simply been PRINTED UP without anything REAL behind it.\nLong ago, we had a \"gold economy\" where all paper money was ACTUALLY BASED\non REAL GOLD, stored in Fort Knox and elsewhere.  Paper money was then\ncalled SILVER CERTIFICATES which meant that anyone could \"cash it in for\nreal silver\" of that exact value.  Paper money stopped saying that\n\"Silver Certificate\" statement, and in recent decades, there is really\nvery little REAL assets which stand behind the astounding amounts of\npaper money we throw around and the $60 trillion dollars of LOAN documents.\nFortunately, virtually NO ONE is aware of this really scary situation.\nIF ANYTHING happens where the United States has to TRY to back up EVEN\nONE TRILLION DOLLARS of all that \"paper\" we WILL be in very sudden,\ndesperate trouble.  There are quite a few countries which currently\nHOLD enormous amounts of US paper.  China is the largest, with their\n$1.8 trillion or so (much from all the WalMart products we have all\nbought which had been manufactured in China).  But China is smart enough\nto NOT cause our American monetary system to collapse, so they know better\nthan to try to sell too much of American assets (for cash) too fast.\nHowever, Saudia Arabia and their $750 billion of American assets COULD\ntear the wheels off the American economy, as soon as they try to\nsell even just $250 billion of them, as that would suck up ALL THE CASH\nwhich EXISTS in AMERICA!  On THAT DAY, all 330 million Americans will\nfind that NOTHING that they consider to be \"assets\" can be sold for cash!\nATM machines will no longer be able to disburse ANY cash, maybe ever again!\nBanks themselves may likely ALL close because they will have NO actual\nmoney that they could dispense to Savings Account Holders or anyone with any\nReal Estate holdings that they want to get a loan on.  In principle, this\ncould all happen IN ONE DAY, although most people will not really grasp\nthe true catastrophe in it.  But as soon as people realize that they\nCANNOT get ANY cash, imagine the effect on those people and governments\nwhich THINK they hold that $60 trillion dollars!  NONE of that is REAL!</p><p>\n\nAs long as NO ONE KNOWS, everyone just bops along with smiles on their\nfaces, because they BELIEVE they have assets of millions of dollars.\nIn 1929, many people in the Stock Market jumped out of windows when they\n(suddenly) realized that the enormous wealth they THOUGHT they owned,\ndid not actually exist!  This current situation will be FAR worse than\nthat!  Rich people today know these things and the moment they realize\nthat catastrophe was coming, they WILL try to WITHDRAW as much of that\nACTUALA $250 billion as they can (to send it to some Island bank for their\npersonal account).  So even the Saudis probably will not actually be\nable to SELL very much of their $750 billion of assets.  And once all\nbanks and all credit cards no longer work, immense numbers of people,\nin the US and around the world, will suddenly discover that they can\nno longer buy food for their families, no matter WHAT a Bank Statement\nmight say.  Wow!</p><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n</p><hr>\n\nSorry for the darkness of these comments, but these are not really\nOPINIONS but nearly certainly COMING FACTS.

Even\nif my comments contain flaws, I would like to think that they should\nbe at least considered, specifically because no one else seems to have\ncome up with any credible solutions to these two enormous problems.\nSo, after I developed the Iraq solution in October 2006, I mailed out\naround 70 letters and e-mailed around 340 notes, to a wide range of\npublic figures. To government and political leaders, to many networks,\nspecific programs that have discussed the problems in Iraq, to thirty\ntwo Political Science Professors in major Universities, to many newspapers,\neven to reporters and others actually in Iraq. Doesn't it seem that\nsome of those people should have had at least some initial interest\nin a new idea?  Even if it were only regarding how and why a Christian\nChurch Pastor was trying to save large numbers of Muslims from dying\nin a civil war?  I have been extremely surprised that in over eleven\nmonths, I have received a grand total of TWO responses from those\n410 contacts!  One was from a Poli Sci Prof who berated me for wasting\nmy and her time. The other was in December 2006 from a reporter in Baghdad\nwho responded that he was VERY interested in hearing any new idea. (But he\nnever again responded to the added information!) I rarely mind\nbeing told that my ideas are without value, so even if he (or any of the\n400 others) thought that the idea was stupid and a waste of time, I would\nhave thought that I should have received a polite rejection???<p>\n\nEach person is free to make their own decisions in life. But I have\nto wonder about the Poli Sci Profs. They ARE knowledgeable in world\nconflicts, since that is what they Teach about!  One would assume that\nthey CARE about their subject, but that appears to have been an\nincorrect assumption! But further, I would have thought that those\n32 Professors would have had a SELFISH reason for wanting to possibly\npromote this concept. There are almost one hundred thousand Political\nScience instructors in the US.  Few of them ever become noted for anything!\nBut I had thought that at least ONE of those 32 Professors would have\nseen an OPPORTUNITY for him/her, in that how many Poli Sci Profs\never even TRY to end a major war? Even if the concept turned out\nnot to work, I had thought that a Professor who chose to alert\nothers in Poli Sci about \"a possible way to end the war in\nIraq.\" would likely have gained massive respect and reputation\namong colleagues!  Like, regarding future EMPLOYMENT possibilities???\nAnd I had NOT expected any of them to commit years of their life to\ndeveloping a concept, but merely maybe an hour or two to see if\nthere might be any positive feedback. Sure, if all the feedback was\nnegative, he/she would have wasted an hour of valuable time!</p><p>\n\nDo our leaders actually CARE about solving these things? I am not\ninsisting that I have any brilliant ideas, but only that leaders should\nbe willing to at least CONSIDER ideas other than their own!  Says\nsomething about trying to do Christian Good Deeds, doesn't it?</p><p>\n\nIn any case, it looks like the leaders and politicians insist on\nforging ahead with their own assumptions that massive amounts of money\nis the ONLY solution to all problems! That is even sadder, that they\nhave such narrow perspectives! Either brute force (Iraq, Afghanistan,\nNorth Korea, Iran, Palestine, Lebanon, etc) or massive amounts of\nAmerican taxpayer money is always the only solution to all problems!\nSpock would say \"Interesting!\"</p><p>\n\n</p><hr>\n\nIn Oct. 2006, I started trying to get authorities to consider\na very unique concept toward ending the war in Iraq, specifically ending\nthe sectarian violence between Shia and Sunni Muslims.  I first tried\nto let Colin Powell be able to get credit for it, but there was no\nresponse from several letters and dozens of e-mails.  I then tried\nto let around 40 other American leaders know about it, starting with\nthe people who were part of the Iraq Study Council, James Baker and\nLee Hamilton and others.  No responses from anyone.  I then sent\npreliminary descriptions to 32 Professors of Political Science\nat major Universities, including DePaul, Purdue (main campus), Purdue\nNorth Central Campus, Purdue Calumet Campus, University of Chicago,\nGovernors State College, Prairie State College, South Suburban\nCollege and others.  In one phone call to SSC, the (woman) Professor\nwas incredibly disrespectful, even telling me that she was really\nbusy and that she should have ended the call five minutes earlier,\nas she hung up on me.  I have always wondered what immensely important\nduties she has that are more important than avoiding the deaths of\n1,500 additional American troops since then, along with around 100,000\nIraqi people!  It must be great to be so important that you can\nblow off a Minister who is trying to save thousands of human lives!<p>\n\nOnly one even sent an e-mail back, and that was\nto tell me to stop wasting my time!  I tried assorted newspapers and\nTV networks and TV programs such as Meet The Press, the Charlie Rose\nShow, Think Tank, McLaughlin Group, the PBS News Hour, Nightline and\nothers, with no responses at all except for a couple automated responses.\nI tried to contact Tom Friedman in several ways.\nI then tried to contact all the news reporters I could in Iraq, such\nas John Burns, Sabrina Tavernise, Bobby Ghosh, Richard Engel,\nDexter Filkins, George Packer, and many others.  No responses.\nI even tried contacting an assortment of Arabic newspapers and\ntelevision media such as al Jazeera.  No responses.</p><p>\n\n<b>I am tempted to wonder if no one really cares!  Or if no one really\nwants to stop that war.</b>  Or that there is some immense confidence\nthat the leaders suddenly know what they are doing!  In any case,\nafter six months of really serious effort to get ANYONE to simply\nlisten to the concept, with zero interest after hundreds of e-mails\nand dozens of letters, I really do not know what else to try.  The only\nremaining thought I had was to hire someone to translate it into\nArabic and then submit it again to Arabic newspapers and television.</p><p>\n\nI had really figured that at least a few people would have responded,\nif only to tell me that it is a dumb idea!  But no one ever even\nhad enough interest to learn what the actual concept was, to form such\nan opinion!  These days, people are all so BUSY that they are only willing\nto waste 10 seconds in reading the first sentence of any communication they\nget, upon which they then believe they TOTALLY UNDERSTAND every nuance\nof any subject, and to also find the correspondence to have wasted their\ntime!  Very strange!  I will always believe that it was Iraq's\none true chance at avoiding an incredibly bloody massive civil war,\nwhich will certainly involve Muslims around the world.</p><p>\n\n\n\n</p><hr>\nEnd of footnote 4\n<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\n\n<a name=\"3\"><font size=\"+2\"><b>Global Warming Issues</b></font></a><br><br>\n\nThere actually seems a credible possibility that the devices that ANYONE\ncan build [to heat their homes and make their hot water] can have a\nhuge effect at correcting the Global Warming problem.

What has never been mentioned is that\nthat represents $10,000 from every single American family (so far)!\nMaybe some American families enjoy giving $10,000 for such a purpose,\nbut most of us could have had far better purposes for the $10,000\nwhich will eventually have to be paid by our own families!<p>\n\n\n\n</p><hr>\nEnd of footnote 5\n<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\n\n<a name=\"6\"><font size=\"+2\"><b>Capture, Killing of Zarqawi</b></font></a><br><br>\n\nThe US Government had insisted on capturing or killing Osama bin Laden\nand Zarqawi almost immediately after 9/11/01, and they soon offered\na $25,000,000 reward for anyone who enabled them to find either one\nof them.  For four years, they had ZERO success, and rarely seemed to even\nhave much of an idea of what REGION either of them were in!<p>\n\nI have no doubt that I deserve to receive the $25MM for Zarqawi!</p><p>\n\nOn <b>Apr. 25, 2006</b>, I sent the following e-mail to half a dozen\nNational News media organizations, including Charlie Rose, ABC Nightline,\nThink Tank, Foreign Exchange, Meet the Press:</p><p>\n\n</p><pre>Hi,\n\n<b>The video of Zarqawi today may have extremely important evidence in it!</b>\nFor the past two years, I have been trying to get word to the CIA regarding\nthis regarding the many outdoor videos of bin Laden.  I know that you have\ncontact with people high in the CIA, so I ask that you inform them of the\nfollowing.\n\nAround two years ago, our Intelligence demonstrated a \"face recognition\nsystem\" at the Super Bowl game.  Each face scanned was quickly compared to\nimages of many terrorists and criminals.  I don't think the success of that\ndemonstration was ever presented, but the basic concept is what I see of\nvalue.\n\nI have recommended that UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) be flown at low\naltitude up and down every valley of Afghanistan, with (two) side directed\ncameras taking an image every second.  The result would be \"a database of\nbackground images from every location\" (with around 150 feet spacing between\nimages, if the images are taken once per second and the aircraft flown at\n100 mph).  Now that Zarqawi made a similar video (probably in Iraq), I\nrecommend the same be done there.\n\n<b>The existing \"face recognition program software\" could then be\nused WITHOUT MODIFICATION.</b>  Instead of hundreds of thousands of photos\nof faces, the database would be filled with hundreds of thousands of\nthese UAV photos of backgrounds.  Then a frame of a bin Laden or Zarqawi\nvideo could be entered as the \"suspect face\", to be compared with\nall the hundreds of thousands of background images in the database.\nThe existing system should then be able to identify a \"few\"\nreasonably possible locations which could have been the background of\nZarqawi.  <b>Within seconds, our Intelligence could know EXACTLY where Zarqawi\nwas on last Friday when he allegedly made that video!</b>  In any case, such\n\"evidence\" seems extremely valuable to me!  I have never gotten any response\nin any previous attempts to apprise our Intelligence regarding this concept.\nI truly believe they might then capture or kill Zarqawi and/or bin Laden\nwithin days!\n\nI was educated as a Nuclear Physicist at the University of Chicago, so I\nlike to think that I have some idea regarding this working as described!\n\nSo I hope you will try to pass word along for me, and for our country's\nsecurity.\n\nCarl Johnson\n</pre><p>\n\n<b>Forty-two days later, they found Zarqawi and killed him.</b>\n<font color=\"#cc7777\"><b>The news\nreports in the first few hours (as on BBC) described that they had\nanalyzed the videotape and figured out where he was, and they announced\nthat that was how they got him.</b></font>  However, just hours later,\nthey were announcing a very different story, where some local\npeople had turned him in.</p><p>\n\nI can understand why they would have done that.  They would clearly want\nto be able to use the same method in finding Usama bin Laden from\nthe videotapes that he would regularly make outdoors.  Obviously,\nthey would not want UBL to know that it was a bad idea to do any\nmore outdoor videotapes.  So I understand that that would have wanted\nthe news media to present a different story.</p><p>\n\n<b>Still, they had chased Zarqawi for more than four years without finding\nhim.  Then I provide my method and 42 days later, Zarqawi is dead,\nand the initial news reports described essentially my exact concept!</b>\n<b>It seems to me that I deserve the $25 million reward that the US\ngovernment offered for information toward the capture or killing of\nZarqawi!</b> Some how, I don't think I will ever be given MY MONEY!</p><p>\n\n</p><hr>\n\nActually, I think I could have qualified for the similar reward regarding\nbid Laden several years earlier.  In late 2002, the US Military believed\nthat bid Laden and many other al Qaeda leaders were living in a very deep\ncave inside some mountains in a very rugged area which separates\nAfghanistan and Pakistan.  My friend Peter Jennings (of ABC News) had aired\nnews reports where it was believed that they were living around 1500 feet\ndeep underground.  The US plans were to use many of their ferociously\npowerful bunker-buster bombs to demolish the entire mountain!<p>\n\nI (and probably many others) found that to be a truly foolish approach.\nIt was pure Military thinking, and would certainly have resulted\nin the killing of thousands of nearby civilians by giant flying\nrocks, parts of the mountain that were blown away!</p><p>\n\nSo I described a far more logical approach to Peter Jennings.  I pointed out\nthat people living inside a cave NEEDED AIR TO BREATHE.  I mentioned that\ncaves generally tended to only have a very few internal passageways\nwhere air could get into the cave system.  I pointed out that the US Military\ncertainly has extremely sensitive infrared imaging equipment which\ncould have monitored the vicinity of the mountain.</p><p>\n\nFinding where DISCARDED air left the cave system would have been\nvery easy, as that air would have become slightly WARMED from the\n98.6°F exhaled breaths of all the people living inside.  Such outlets\nwould likely be high on the mountain, as such warmed air tends to rise,\neven inside caves.  (It is a scientific process called thermosiphoning.)\nHowever, I felt that the value of finding where\nair was LEAVING the mountain was of limited value.  Yes, small bombs\ncould cause such outlets to become sealed shut, but a large mountain\ncould contain a lot of air, and even without circulation, people might\nbe able to live a year on the remaining air supply inside a large mountain.</p><p>\n\nBut the valuable part of what I described to Mr. Jennings was that\nthere had to be INTAKES of air into the cave system!  They would\ncertainly be LOW on the mountain or even slightly away from the\nmountain.  Again, infrared imaging, as well as precision radar, could\ndetect MOTION patterns of airflows in the area.  Good Technicians\nshould be able to use computers to discover statistical patterns in\nthose airflows, to (quickly) discover WHERE they were.</p><p>\n\nI noted to Peter that such INTAKES represented critical air supplies\nfor any residents INSIDE the mountain.  I then mentioned to him two\ndifferent approaches.  The less desirable one was to use small bombs to\nseal off those air intakes, but again, that could leave large amounts\nof air already inside the mountain, for months of survival.  I then\nsuggested to Peter that if deadly airborne poisons were simply airdropped\nnear the entrances of such airpaths, within HOURS, the entire cave\nsystem inside the mountain would be filled with such poisonous gases.\nIf the poison chosen was not obvious by smell or appearance,\nit seemed certain to me that within a day or two, anything living\nINSIDE the caves would have died!</p><p>\n\nAs generally was true, Mr. Jennings was extremely attentive to my\nsuggestions.  His position as a world-famous Journalist gave him\neasy access to the ears of virtually everyone in power!  And he\nlater informed me that he had called a couple Generals in the\nPentagon (without identifying them to me) to describe my approach.</p><p>\n\nPeter later seemed surprised that they did not seem to ever try my\nconcept.  It certainly was far simpler than what they had decided\nto try to do (bomb the entire mountain to oblivion!), a lot quicker,\nand a lot cheaper to do!</p><p>\n\nI realize that my concept was fairly complex in some of its details,\nand maybe Peter was not able to get the Generals to fully grasp\nthe concept or its premise.  But I still see that as a far more\nlikely successful way of eliminating bin Laden back in 2002!  But,\nlike with Zarqawi four years later, I have a feeling that I would\nnever have been given the $25 million reward!  Of course, the fact\nthat Peter Jennings was fully aware of my sourcing that concept, and that\nHE was the method where the Military first learned about it, I want\nto believe that my friend Peter would have stood up for my case,\nand somehow gotten the Pentagon to \"quietly\" gotten the\nreward to me!  But there seemed no indication that any Military\neffort along these lines was ever tried, or if they were, no news of\nthem ever leaked out.  In any case, bin Laden was apparently not killed\nin that mountain, and so I guess I didn't deserve any reward then\nanyway!  But, still, it sure seemed to me (and to Peter) that my\napproach made a lot of logical sense!</p><p>\n\n\n</p><hr>\nEnd of footnote 6\n<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\n\n\n\n<a name=\"8\"><font size=\"+2\"><b>To FIX the Stock Market!</b></font></a><br><br>\n\n<b>The US Congress would simply pass a Law where NO Trader or Mutual\nFund would be permitted to BUY OR SELL more than 1% of their holdings\nof any specific company on any one day!</b>  Period!  That would\ninstantly and completely eliminate the wild speculation on\nstock price changes and would re-install the original intent of the\nStock Markets as being a source of financing of businesses.<p>\n\nOK.  As a Physicist, this would seem out of my bailiwick.  But Physicists\nare VERY logical people, and I believe I see TWO things that should\nIMMEDIATELY (Oct 2008) be done!  Of course, no one of actual importance\nwill ever read this, so my thoughts on this really do not matter,\ndo they?  And you are free to agree or disagree with the following,\nbut I do NOT intend to be \"debating\" this matter with\nthousands of people who each feel they have even better ideas!</p><p>\n\nFirst, we must note that the ORIGINAL intent of the Stock Market was\nto provide a constant supply of money that is needed to support\nthe many businesses which need it to operate.  Fine.  It provided\nthe money for companies to use to start and build their businesses.</p><p>\n\nAnd as long as stock market transactions were SLOW, it seemed to work\npretty well.  Millions of INDIVIDUAL stockholders may or may not\ndecide to buy or sell stock on a particular day, and CHANGES in the\noverall RATING (value) of any one company would or could rarely change\nby more than 1% in a week or a month.  Fine.</p><p>\n\nBut the PURPOSE of the Stock Market greatly changed, primarily about\n30 years ago.  It became a GAMBLING GAME for a very small number of\npeople.  Unfortunately, it was and is not an entirely FAIR gambling\ngame, as those same people have the capability of MANIPULATING the\nmarket to their own PERSONAL ends.</p><p>\n\nThe well-being of a company is no longer of any importance at all!\nAnd the value that a stock trades at has often changed at fantastic\nspeeds, where the (alleged) total value of a company sometimes DOUBLES\nin a single day, or HALVES!  This has NOTHING to do with the actual\ncompany, and rarely has much to do with the company's sales or success.\nA simple RUMOR which is good or bad can cause EVERYONE to suddenly\nwant to either buy or sell the stock of that company, and there is\nNO importance any more of whether the rumor was even true!</p><p>\n\nAn example seems appropriate, which has been repeated EVERY DAY for many\nyears!  A stock is described as having a particular value, say $10\nper share, at the start of a trading day.  One of those few powerful\npeople (who have access to massive money or credit) decides that\nhe thinks he can make some money on the stock of that\ncompany.  So he BUYS UP maybe 100,000,000 shares of that company, maybe\nin a quick series of purchases.  ALL THE OTHER TRADERS AND INVESTORS SEE\nthe enormous traffic in the stock of that company AND that the stock\nprice is rapidly going up.  So THEY want to buy in (with the intent\nof also getting very rich very fast).  And everyone then sees that the\ntraffic in that stock is growing even faster and the prices are shooting\nup even faster.  So, maybe by the end of the SAME DAY, the price of a\nshare of that company's stock has risen spectacularly to maybe $20.</p><p>\n\nAnd at THIS point, the person who STARTED this whole thing decides to\nSELL those 100 million shares he bought that same morning.  But now he\ncan SELL them at $20 per share when he had bought them that same morning for\n$10 per share.  In this single company's stock, in a single day, he\nfirst SPENT one billion to buy the stock, but then RECEIVED TWO billion\nlater that same day!  <b>In a single day, with a single stock, he\nhas just made a personal profit of one billion dollars!</b></p><p>\n\nAnd he is proud of himself for having accomplished something!</p><p>\n\nBut what did he actually accomplish?  After he sells all his\nstocks, everyone else will see the massive selling (which is NEVER\nidentified as being from ONE seller or a million sellers, which is\nincredibly useful in this situation for them!) and they will also\nsell.  And the amount they could sell for will drop rapidly, possibly\nback to the original $10 per share.</p><p>\n\nDid the COMPANY benefit at all from this?  No, because their total\nvalue of all their stock did not change after the whole day was done.</p><p>\n\nThe Trader made his billion dollars.  Where did that money come from?\nWas it printed up just to give to him?  No.  It actually came from\nthe LOSSES of exactly one billion dollars by OTHER INVESTORS and TRADERS!\nThose are the large numbers of people who got in late, and had to buy that\nstock for $18 or $20 per share, but then quickly discovered that the\nprice soon plummeted and they had to TRY to sell it for $14 or $12 or\n$10 per share, thereby losing money on EVERY share of it.  EACH of them\nmight have only owned a few hundred or few thousand shares, so their\nINDIVIDUAL losses might have been moderate.  But COLLECTIVELY, they\nnecessarily lost that billion dollars that day!</p><p>\n\nIF there was any sort of MEDIA REPORT which indicated that that particular\ncompany was ABOUT TO ANNOUNCE a cure for cancer or some super-efficient\nvehicle, it even gives the people who dream up such schemes a sort of\nCREDIBILITY upon which the herd of later investors would enthusiastically\njump!  And they KNOW that!  In some cases, the Traders KNEW some\nsuch fact BEFORE it was otherwise known, but that sort of Insider Trading\nwas made illegal when a lot of them were cheating other investors\nin such ways.  But it still happens every day, but the Traders are just far\nmore cautious now to make sure not to leave any evidence that they had\npreviously known of what was about to happen or be said.  The entire\nprocess has evolved a lot, to a point where actual Inside Information\n(for which they could be sent to prison) is generally no longer even\nnecessary, and simply a RUMOR is all that is needed to enable\ndoing this.  And they know that they could NEVER be sent to prison\nfor acting on a rumor!</p><p>\n\nThey DON'T call that cheating each other, and essentially they ALL\nneed to do such things just to be competitive with all the others\nwho do it.  And so there has developed an astounding tunnel-vision\nregarding ONLY looking for HUGE PROFITS TODAY, where no other considerations\nmatter.  Such as the effects on the company whose stocks are used\nfor such trickery.</p><p>\n\nActually, this sort of manipulation of the value of a stock was\nopenly done and very common in the 1920s, and it was a direct\ncause of the Stock Market Crash of 1929 and the following\nGreat Depression. So Laws were passed to make such behaviors illegal.\nThe problem is that top Executives in Wall Street are very smart, and\nthey have found several ways to EFFECTIVELY do the same today but\nwithout any evidence that they have done anything wrong. They see\nnothing wrong in using such methods, which are known to have been\nthe direct cause of the Great Depression, as long as they believe\nthey cannot get caught!</p><p>\n\nThere is a slightly more legal variant of this, which is definitely\nused by every Trader, every day!  Say that we see a Stock that is\ncurrently $10.00.  And a Trader FEELS LIKE GAMBLING!  He THINKS that\nstock will rise by 1%, up to $10.10 that day.  So he buys the\n100 million shares.  It turns out that IF HE WAS RIGHT IN HIS GAMBLE,\nand he would sell all those shares at the end of the day, he would\n\"earn\" ten cents on each of those shares, or $10 million\non that single stock in that single day.  AND, of course, he knows\nthat the EFFECT of his buying all that stock will be seen by all\nother traders and investors, which NEARLY GUARANTEES that his\n\"gamble\" will turn out to be true, and not actually\nmuch of a gamble at all!</p><p>\n\nThis IS what the modern Stock Market is!  It has virtually NOTHING\nto do with the initial reasons for stock markets!  It is simply\na giant game of Monopoly, where if you are big enough and have access\nto enough money, you can CAUSE self-perpetuating profits for yourself\n(but at the cost of the exact same amount of losses by other investors!)</p><p>\n\nThe Stock Market is obviously a lot more complex than this simplified\ndescription, but the core of its operation is essentially as described\nhere.  MOST stocks are now bought and sold by DAY TRADERS, people who\nONLY intend to own any particular stock for a very brief time.\nMUTUAL FUNDS have made this even worse, as the few individuals who\noperate such funds can buy and sell billions of dollars of stocks\nevery day, and they do.</p><p>\n\nA significant point to be made here is that REALITY has very little\nplace in this whole operation!  The ACTUAL value of all the assets\nof General Motors is irrelevant!  It is ONLY what the few handfuls\nof individuals who can buy and sell billions of dollars of stocks\nbelieve that matters!  And, because of the rather incestuous\narrangement, those people tend to follow each other's movements\nwith similar movements of their own, because they do NOT want to be\nfound to be the person who moved too slow and therefore caused his\nFund to be left out of great profits.</p><p>\n\nAnother amazing factor is an absolute lack of transparency.  Absolutely\nno one seems to know WHO is buying or selling or HOW MUCH or even\nwhether they actually have the funds to back such purchases!  In fact,\nthere have been MANY times when Traders officially BOUGHT massive\namounts of stock when they did not have the available money to do so,\nASSUMING that they would again sell it all within a few hours,\nat the expected profit, in order to provide the money that SHOULD\nHAVE EXISTED in order to even start the whole thing!  There is a LOT\nof this sort of trickery which occurs every day related to the\nStock Market, but since NO ONE EVER IS ABLE TO KNOW (due to the\nlack of transparency), they are all able to get away with such things!\nIt is truly unbelievable that it can work at all!  It is virtually\nONLY a gambling game between a very small numbers of heavy hitters!</p><p>\n\nFor at least five years, I have speculated about an even darker\npossibility that I see possible.  I usually describe it about like this:\nImagine that you have a roomful of people who all agree that the\nHEALTH of the stock market is critically important to their individual\nsuccesses and wealth.  Under NO conditions, could they ALLOW any really\nbad things to ever occur.  These people would be those couple dozen\npeople who each have the capability of buying or selling billions\nof dollars of stock at any personal whim.</p><p>\n\nSo they see that some important stock seems to be dropping in price.\nOne or more of them immediately offers to buy a billion dollars of that\nstock.  Since all investors and Traders would immediately see that huge\npurchase, any public sense of panic would vanish, and PROBABLY millions\nof private investors might each then decide to buy a little bit, where the\nperson would then be able to sell off the billion dollars of stocks,\nsmoothly and INVISIBLY.</p><p>\n\nI often felt that such an incestuous relationship was the ONLY\nexplanation for days when there was horrendous business news, but then\nthe Stock Market shot UP by 400 points!  Such things should NOT be\npossible!  I remember one day a year or two ago when Ford announced\na tremendous loss of billions of dollars, the unemployment figure had\ngreatly risen, and two other pieces of major negative business news\noccurred, and yet the Stock Market shot up that day!  I tend to think\nthat COULD NOT have happened without some sort of collusion like what\nI had speculated.  Of course, since there is no transparency, there could\nnever have been any way to prove that my suspicions might have been true!</p><p>\n\n</p><h3>The Solution</h3>\n\nWith the preamble above, we can now consider the suggestion.  Is it to\ngive $110 billion to AIG, which they immediately put to use in sending\nthemselves on a luxury holiday?  No.  Does it involve ANY US Taxpayer\nmoney?  No.  It is even quite simple to do!  <b>The US Congress would\nsimply pass a Law where NO Trader or Mutual Fund would be permitted\nto BUY OR SELL more than 1% of their holdings on any one day!</b>  Period!<p>\n\nThat would ELIMINATE much of the INCENTIVE of the Brokers to be\nDay Trading to swipe some quick millions of dollars, because they would\nNOT be allowed to be buying or selling that large a fraction of their\nholdings ON ANY SINGLE DAY.  <b>It would inspire and require LONGER-TERM\nPLANNING on the part of Traders and Investors, getting back to the\nINITIAL REASON for the Stock Market to exist.</b></p><p>\n\nThis is in total contrast to the current approaches of Washington,\nof PROVIDING hundreds of billions of (taxpayer) dollars to allegedly\nstabilize Wall Street.  Washington can't seem to realize that by\nENSURING plenty of money, with the current rules, it ENCOURAGES\nevery Trader to make his best guess as to WHEN he should\n\"buy absolutely everything!\"  Given the depressed level\nthat they all believe the Market is now in, they each see an OBVIOUS\nway that they can make THEMSELVES many billions of dollars, by\nbuying enormous amounts of stock when it is low and then selling it\nALL a few days later.  Why doesn't Washington see that they will be\nFEEDING such greedy people?  That some of our taxpayer billions will\nDIRECTLY go into billions of personal profits, leaving the Market\nno better than before?  And it is ALL because the Traders are ALLOWED\nto make fantastically huge purchases and sales of stocks every few\nminutes!</p><p>\n\nThe <b>ONE PERCENT PER DAY rule</b> would also eliminate the tremendous\nsurges and then personal incentives\nof Traders to be buying and selling obscene amounts of stock, just\nto be running with the herd!  <b>The Stock Market would NECESSARILY\nbe based more on sanity, as it should be!</b>  The ACTUAL VALUE\nof the total assets (minus liabilities) of any company would be\ncarefully examined before making any major stock commitment in that\ncompany.</p><p>\n\n<b>As long as Traders can expect to be able to make billions of\ndollars in what they call daily \"profit taking\", nothing\nwill really change!</b>  It would not matter much what the\ngovernment might try to invoke, human nature would find a way\nto bypass it, because they can taste those enormous profits!</p><p>\n\nThis simple concept would FORCE all investors and Traders to essentially\nadopt Warren Buffet's LONG view of the Stock Market.  Of ONLY buying\nwhen there was ACTUAL perceived value existing, and no longer\nrunning thither and yon in buying and selling stocks as if they were\nsimply scoring markers in a game of Monopoly!</p><p>\n\nI actually have a SECOND recommendation as well!  I believe that if\nmy friend Peter Jennings was still with us, he would have instituted\nthe following, so if it should ever be adopted, my hope would be that\nit be called the Jennings approach!</p><p>\n\nI believe that Peter would have invited: Warren Buffett, Bill Gates,\nMelissa Gates, President Sarcozy of France, Tony Blair, Robert Redford,\nCharlie Rose, Michael Jordan, Will Smith,\nRichard Petty, Bono, President da Silva\nof Brazil, at least one prominent Japanese and two prominent Chinese and\ntwo prominent Indian, and a few others; to a regular meeting in a remote\nlocation such as Mr. Redford's Ranch.  There, with NO ONE ELSE than them\npresent, they would have free-wheeling discussions about ALL matters\nthat are critical to the world's people.  NO politicians are in that mix\n(but Jimmy Carter seems a possible exception to that), and no bureaucrats.</p><p>\n\nThe point would be that they would bring up all kinds of ideas and probably\nimmediately shoot them down.  And occasionally, if they felt they needed\n\"expert advice\" regarding the Economy or Nuclear Power or Global\nWarming or anything else, THEY could decide to invite SEVERAL experts\nin the appropriate fields (for only one day) where they would then\nbe able to ask their questions.  Several so that they could hear\ndiffering views on any specific issue.</p><p>\n\nThe theory would be that they would FIND A CONSENSUS regarding what\nshould be said or done.  And THEN, EACH of them would return to\ntheir normal life and start to have Press Conferences, where they\nEXPLAIN TO THE PUBLIC WHY they feel confident that the solution they\nhave adopted seems to make sense.  A member of the public would\ntherefore see Bono on TV describing the EXACT same plan that Tony Blair\nsimilarly presented, which is identical to the plan that Michael\nJordan and Bill Gates would be saying.</p><p>\n\nThe POINT of this is that THE PUBLIC would very quickly see that\nMANY of the famous people THAT THEY RESPECT all seem to be in\ncomplete agreement about what is needed to be done.</p><p>\n\nThis is actually a modern version of what Franklin Roosevelt had\ndone to INSPIRE CONFIDENCE in the American people in 1933.  The\npeople's lives had actually not materially improved, but they all\nFELT confident that FDR \"knew how to lead them back to\nprosperity and happiness\".  (As it turned out, FDR made many\nbad decisions regarding things to try, but as long as the people\nBELIEVED in his leadership, they were all confident that the US\nwould recover.)</p><p>\n\nSo the final aspect of this suggestion is that the group of 20 people\nprobably would KNOW when they needed to get together.  If Peter\nJennings was still with us, he certainly would have known, and he\nwould certainly have simply called each of them and asked them if their\nschedules could include a Meeting for a few days at XX/XX/XX to XX/XX/XX.\nBut it seems good that if the PUBLIC saw need for them to meet, THEY\ncould somehow initiate the process for them as well!</p><p>\n\nPEOPLE would feel INVOLVED.  They would feel CONFIDENT.  And they\nwould TRUST those people who they had earlier learned to have great\nrespect for.</p><p>\n\n\n</p><hr>\nEnd of footnote 8\n<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\n\n<a name=\"9\"><font size=\"+2\"><b>To FIX the American Economy!</b></font></a><br><br>\n\nAmerica faces enormous problems ahead.  It is NOT just that\nmillions of houses are worth less than people owe on them,\nin other words, they have no equity in the house they live in,\nor that they also rarely have any savings, or that their 401-k\nand other retirement plans have lost trillions of dollars due to\nproblems in the stock market.<p>\n\nA CENTRAL problem in coming years will be there will be few JOBS\nfor the many millions of people who are out of work.  A similar\nsituation occurred during the 1930s, but it was actually BETTER\nthen because there were millions of MANUFACTURING jobs in the US\nthen.  Now, there are not, because the NAFTA and GATT agreements\nhad enabled and encouraged nearly all manufacturers to move\ntheir factories to countries where workers are ENTHUSIASTIC\nat working for 50 cents per hour, instead of American workers who\nwere generally unhappy at being paid $30/hour for the same work.</p><p>\n\nA complicating factor is that, because BOTH men and women now work,\nthere are essentially twice as many American people who will be\nsearching for the few jobs which will be available.  An interesting\naspect of this is that it figures that there will be soon millions\nof workers who WILL BE WILLING to work for BELOW minimum wage,\nout of desperation to earn enough for food for their family!\nHow will employers deal with that, as they will get into deep trouble\nif they ever pay any employee less than Minimum Wage!</p><p>\n\nIn any case, I believe there is a really obvious AND WONDERFUL\nsolution for much of this!</p><p>\n\nIn the 1930s, FDR set up many work programs, where millions of\npeople earned money (from the government) for manual labor,\nin building the road system of the country and other infrastructure\nsystems.</p><p>\n\nLeaders seem to start becoming aware of how terrible the infrastructure\nof the US has become, because very little funding has been allocated\nfor repairs for many years.  So there is definitely a NEED\nfor massive work on the infrastructure in the US.</p><p>\n\nIt will be interesting to see IF the government chooses to approach\nthis as they traditionally have, of HIRING giant contractors to\ndo the repairs, ASSUMING those contractors would hire huge numbers\nof workers to do the work.  This happens to be an extremely inefficient\napproach, I believe.  An obvious example was when President Bush\ngave $100 billion (of our taxpayer money) to a handful of very large\ncontractors (who also happened to be good friends of his!) and where\nit was found by Reporters later that only about $1 billion of actual\nwork had gotten done.  The other $99 billion sort of disappeared\ninside those giant corporations!  Is THAT what they are going to do\non a much larger scale this time?</p><p>\n\nIt seems that the approach that FDR used in the 1930s was far wiser.\nThe government DIRECTLY offered to hire millions of manual laborers,\nat modest pay rates, and those jobs were all rapidly filled.  Those\nmillions of workers did not have much Prosperity right then, but at\nleast they had consistent income so that their families were able\nto eat.</p><p>\n\nI am mentioning this here for a reason!  Around 1990, I had invented\nand (nearly) fully Designed an impressive NEW transportation system\nfor the US.  The transportation would NOT require any fossil fuels\nto be burned, a wonderful side benefit!  Automobiles and (most) trucks\nwould be replaced by a system where people and products traveled at\n200 mph instead of the 55 mph on highways, with NO traffic jams or any\nother delays.  Better yet, the system is so efficient that the\nfees for traveling from Chicago to New York should be around $5 (one way),\nless than 1/20 of the cost of an airplane trip (which would actually\ninvolve about the same total amount of travel time!)</p><p>\n\nWhen you have been at drive-through banks, you have seen the pneumatic\ntubes and canisters which transfer papers and money very rapidly\ninto and out of the bank.  In the late 1980s, I discovered a way\nwhere a large version of that concept could transport people and\nproducts in very large canisters (which I called pods), AND that\nit was possible to use a well-known Bernoulli Effect of Physics\nto enable the pods to essentially FLY inside of a system of fixed\ntubes.  This results in very little friction, and extremely efficient\noperation.  FAR better than the average 21% overall efficiency of\nmodern cars!</p><p>\n\nHERE is where the SOLUTION arrives!</p><p>\n\nFirst, such a National system would require many MILLIONS of\npods to be manufactured, either to transport products or to transport\npeople.  General Motors, Ford and Chrysler happen to already\nhave many very large factories, which could easily be converted\nto making such pods rather than conventional vehicles.  MILLIONS\nOF JOBS would be involved and VERY RELIABLE for many years!</p><p>\n\nSecond, the system of the tubes themselves are designed as being\nEXISTING concrete culverts (of 5 foot diameter).  My plan involved\ninstalling THREE of these concrete tubes down the Median of each\nInterstate highway (one each direction and the third to take\nthe traffic when either needed any repairs).  Many other locations\nof such tubes could be installed in other locations, as desired.\nMILLIONS OF CONSTRUCTION JOBS for several years would provide\nreliable income for other Americans.</p><p>\n\nThird, the infrastructure of the US would not just be REPAIRED,\nbut REPLACED with an entire system that was GREEN (no fossil fuels),\nVERY FAST, and incredibly useful.</p><p>\n\nFourth, hundreds of thousands of computer and electronics\nworkers would assemble the computer control system for this system.\nEach pod would have a bar-coding pattern on its side, and as it\npassed scanners along the system, its exact position would always\nbe known to the computer.  When that pod needed to be diverted\ninto a different tube path to get to the desired destination,\nthe system would use all that information to divert just that\none pod, leaving all the other pods ahead of it and behind it\non their original path.</p><p>\n\nI trust you see that quite a few million people would be earning\nat least moderate amounts of income, for a number of years while\nthe American economic system gradually recovered from its problems.\nAnd at the end, we would wind up with a wonderful NEW transportation\nsystem that was far BETTER than anything existing today.</p><p>\n\nFinally, NO NEW TECHNOLOGIES are necessary or involved!  This could\nbe started IMMEDIATELY!</p><p>\n\nWITHOUT something like this, the US is certain to have severe\neconomic and financial problems for quite a few years.  It seems\nextremely obvious to me that this concept SHOULD be at least\ncarefully examined, and then probably IMMEDIATELY implemented!</p><p>\n\nA web-site which provides a more extensive overview of this TRANS\nsystem is at <b><a href=\"trans/index.html\">Driverless Vehicles - High Speed Transportation</a> - High Speed Rail, but better, TRANS Super-Efficient Transportation System</b>.</p><p>\n\nWe also have a presentation at <a href=\"public/wind7.html\">Wind-Powered Electricity for 1000 Homes</a> Practical Large-Scale Wind-Generated Electricity (1 MegaWatt for 1000 houses)</p><p>\n\n\n</p><hr>\nEnd of footnote 9\n<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\n\n<a name=\"10\"><font size=\"+2\"><b>Bodyfat Disposal</b></font></a><br><br>\n\nIt does not seem appropriate here to discuss all the biochemistry\ninvolved in when bodyfat is used by the body, but suffice it to say that\nthe complex lipid carbohydrate molecules are broken down into\nsmaller molecules (often acetyl coenzyme A) to be transported by the blood to\n(muscle) cells that need the energy they contain.  There are a LOT of\nchemical reactions which occur, many of which are in what is called the\nKreb's Cycle.<p>\n\nThe results of that Cycle are ATP molecules that are compact energy\ncarriers, and also liquid water and dissolved carbon dioxide gas.\nThese are now waste products of the body, and they are primarily\ntransported by the blood to the lungs, where the water can evaporate\nto make the outgoing breath get up to near 100% relative humidity\n(to be able to get rid of the greatest amount of water per breath)\nand also up to about 4.4% total concentration of carbon dioxide\n(limited by Dalton's Law of Partial pressures).</p><p>\n\nBy the way, you might see the connection here between when you do\nserious exercise and then have to breathe heavily for a while?\nThe body has to have that heavy breathing to actually get RID of the\ncarbon dioxide it produced!\nIn doing strenuous exercise, you DO use up some bodyfat molecules (but a\ndisappointingly small amount of them.  We will shortly see in the Technical\nparagraph below that even when we exercise hard enough where our breath is\nTWICE normal, that only removes the carbon from around 1/1100 pound\nof bodyfat per minute.  <b>A full hour of such strenuous exercise and we can\nremove only around 1/20 pound of bodyfat!</b>).  Due to the requirements\nof the exercise, the body naturally accesses some of your energy\nsupplies, first, the sugars, which are most easily accessed\nfast, but then eventually the bodyfat stores.  As those sugar or lipid\nmolecules are oxidized, carbon dioxide molecules are formed, which get\ncarried in the blood to the lungs and then exhaled with the next outgoing\nbreath.  If you do TWICE as much exertion, then twice as much\nof the lipid (bodyfat) molecules get oxidized, and twice as much\nexhaled breath is needed to carry all that carbon away from the body!\nNow you know!  (You also breathe more heavily to get more oxygen\nINTO the body, to be able to do all that oxidization of all that\ncarbon into carbon dioxide.  The body has an immense number of\nunique chemical reactions, and we have greatly simplified the\nmatter here!)</p><p>\n\n<b>This brief discussion is intended to show you that virtually\nALL the carbon that can leave your body must leave by your\nexhaled breath, and that all the impressive claims of flashy\nadvertising which claim otherwise are simply not credible.</b>\nIF some program causes you to BREATHE MORE HEAVILY, either\ndeeper breathing or faster breathing or both, THAT WILL directly\nincrease your body's ability to get rid of undesired bodyfat.\nSuch a program also needs to cause your Metabolism to\nspeed up to actually process/oxidize some bodyfat and make the carbon\ndioxide available to the lungs.\n<b>So the next time you see any of those ads on TV or elsewhere,\nTHINK about whether they are describing any credible way where\nyour breathing is increased.  If not, there is no realistic\nreason to spend money to buy what they are promoting!</b></p><p>\n\nOn a more technical level, each INCOMING breath draws in\nair which is at the natural 0.039% of carbon dioxide, and each\noutgoing breath contains around a maximum of 4.4% of carbon dioxide.\nWhen sitting, we breathe around 12 times per minute and each normal\nbreath is around 0.5 liter of air.  This all means that in each\nminute of normal breathing, we CAN exhale around 0.26 liter of carbon\ndioxide.  The actual exhaled air is not always saturated\nwith carbon dioxide but it is usually close.</p><p>\n\nThis means that each minute, we each (normally) exhale around 0.0405 gram\nof carbon dioxide, or around 1/1000 of a pound.  (In an entire\nyear of normal breathing, we each exhale around 500 pounds of\ncarbon dioxide!)  In each minute, this includes around 1/3500 pound\n(or 0.11 gram) of actual carbon atoms.  <b>They could have come from\nnormal foods or from stored bodyfat.</b>  If they had come from normal food\nmolecules, that represents around 1/1400 pound (0.3 gram) of food which\nwould \"disappear\" during that minute (of normal breathing).\nAt 2200 Calories per pound of normal food, that is around 1.6 Calories\nof food per minute gets used up.  If they had instead come from lipid\nbodyfat molecules, (a far more compact source of energy) that would\nrepresent around 1/2200 pound (0.2 gram) of bodyfat which would disappear\nduring that minute (of normal breathing).  This ONLY occurs when the person\nhas not recently eaten enough food to provide the energy needed for\nall bodily activities, where stored energy needs to be used up.  At 3500\nCalories per pound of bodyfat, that again means that around 1.6 Calories\nworth of energy would be provided, this time from bodyfat, every minute.\nSince a day includes 1440 minutes, either case here accounts for the 2,200\nCalories of energy that our metabolism needs to use up every day to keep us\nalive.  Also, 1.6 Calories per minute times 60 minutes is around 100 Calories\nper hour of sedentary activity, which also agrees with the ASHRAE\nfigures for heat given off by a human body.</p><p>\n\nThis then confirms that each minute of regular breathing necessarily\nrequires the exhaling of the carbon atoms from whatever food or bodyfat\nmaterials were consumed during that minute.  <b>That process of exhaling is\nessentially the ONLY process the body has of removing carbon from itself!</b></p><p>\n\nIn a bizarre Physicist's-view of this matter, I tend to wonder if\nsomeone could somehow \"slightly extra-ventilate\" for an extended\ntime, and whether that might result in some bodyfat loss WITHOUT\neven having to work out?  Strange, huh?  I wonder if the brain would\nDECIDE to increase its Basal Metabolism, just because it now could.  And\nwhether anyone could be trained to learn to keep up the (10%) faster or\ndeeper breathing on a regular basis is not known.  Sounds like something a\nResearch Lab should do a Study on!  Since we know that we breathe\naround 12 times each minute, and thereby exhale the carbon atoms from\nall the day's pound of eaten food, the idea of training a brain-body\nto increase that breathing rate to 13 times per minute seems reasonable.\nNo one would even notice this slight change, and we know that the\nhuman body can be trained in thousands of ways.  The point would be that\ninstead of exhaling the carbon from 16 ounces of eaten food (as calculated\nhere and in the <b><a href=\"public3/weight.html\">Bodyfat, Weight Loss, the Physics of Body Weight Control</a></b>\npresentation, that minor change would enable the body to get rid\nof the carbon from an additional 1.3 ounces of food materials, each day.\nIf done for an entire year, that would possibly represent an additional\nconsumption of over 30 pounds of bodyfat!  Interesting!</p><p>\n\nPhysicists always try to see reasons for failure in\nsuch hypotheses.  In this case, if the body was actually not\ndoing any extra work, maybe the brain would see no reason to\ninitiate additional Metabolic activity.  Human and animal\npatterns suggest that no wasteful decisions like that are made,\nin order to maintain maximum survival capability for some future\nemergency.  So even if the breathing was slightly increased,\nit might be that the CONCENTRATION of carbon\ndioxide in the exhaled breath might simply become reduced!</p><p>\n\nAnother Physicist's aspect of this, which seems far more interesting,\nis <b>the question of whether overweight people might breathe more\nshallowly than other people.</b>  I have not located\nany research that has ever been done on this subject.  Wouldn't it be sort\nof funny of the entire obesity problem might be eased or even solved\nby simply teaching overweight people to breathe slightly more deeply?\nI have no idea whether that would actually be of value or not, but\nit certainly seems to be worthy of serious scientific investigation!</p><p>\n\nWe have a presentation at <a href=\"public3/weight.html\">Bodyfat, Weight Loss, the Physics of Body Weight Control</a></p><p>\n\n\n</p><hr>\nEnd of footnote 10\n<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\n\n<a name=\"11\"><font size=\"+2\"><b>Energy in a PERFECT Battery-Powered Car</b></font></a><br><br>\n\nSeveral of the automotive-related presentations in this Domain include\nthe complete analysis of calculating the Aerodynamic Drag of any\nvehicle and also the Tire Drag.  It is not that difficult but we are\ngoing to leave out the details here.  The details and calculations are\nin the specific pages about those subjects.  Suffice it to say that an\nextremely aerodynamic sports car might have an Aerodynamic Drag\nof 100 pounds at 60 mph speed (which is essentially used up in\npushing the air out of the way of the vehicle, and then in turbulence\nas that air again filled the space where the vehicle had just passed\nthrough) which has the effect\nof transferring that energy to the air and thereby very slightly\nheating it up!  Similarly, it is easy to see that around 30 pounds\nof Tire Drag would exist.  This energy mostly gets used up in flexing\nthe sidewalls of the tires every time they rotate, which causes the\ntires to get too hot to touch after an extended highway drive.\nAdd the two to get the total vehicle Drag, in this case 130 pounds.<p>\n\nFor comparison, a C-4 Corvette, a rather aerodynamic car, has an\naerodynamic drag of about 117 pounds and a tire drag of about 48\npounds at 60 mph, for a total vehicle Drag of 165 pounds.  So the\nnumbers we are using are very optimistic!</p><p>\n\nBy multiplying that 130 pounds total Drag by the vehicle velocity\n(88 feet/second, which is what 60 mph is), we get 11,440 lb-ft/sec.  This can\nbe converted into other forms, such as 20.8 horsepower or 15.5 kilowatts.</p><p>\n\n<b>IF WE ASSUME THE VEHICLE AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS ABSOLUTELY PERFECTLY\nEFFICIENT</b> we would then see that a one-hour, 40 mph, drive would use up\n15.5 kWh of power.  So say that it was a battery-powered, electric motor\nvehicle.  Once the batteries had used up the necessary 15.5 kWh of\nelectricity, <b>it would have to be replaced by re-charging the batteries.</b></p><p>\n\nIt is clear that we would need just over 9 hours of charging at the\nmaximum 15 amperes that a standard home 110 volt electrical outlet\ncould provide (9h * 15a * 110v = 14.9 kWh) or that a standard heavy-duty\nextension cord could carry.  <b>NINE HOURS!</b></p><p>\n\nTo drive ONE hour, NINE hours of charging would be required, simply by\nthe basic Laws of science regarding Conservation of Energy!</p><p>\n\nBut MOST promotional literature for electric vehicles talks about\ntwo-hour or three-hour recharge times, and they nearly always make\nsure to mention that a standard outlet and a standard heavy-duty extension\ncord could be used!  Do you see where their statements are attempting to\nviolate very basic laws of science?</p><p>\n\nWhat they are usually doing is applying the common aspects of trickery\nused in most modern advertising.  A woodstove might be advertised as\n\"able to heat your entire home\" and also \"able to hold a\nfire for 20 hours.\".  Each statement is potentially true, and they\nprobably have tested evidence that each is NOT a lie so they do not get\nsued!  But their advertising LEADS READERS TO THINK THAT BOTH ARE\nTRUE AT THE SAME TIME, which turns out to simply be impossible!  It COULD be\nfired hard to produce enough heat for a small house, but then the wood\ngets used up fast and is gone in an hour.  But if it is used to only\nheat one small room on a mild day, yes, it might hold a fire for 20 hours.</p><p>\n\nIn the case of electric vehicles, a common statement is that it can be\nre-charged in just two hours.  Yes, that might be true if you had only\ngone to the grocery store!  And they make SEPARATE claims regarding\nhigh speed or long driving range.  If I was forced to have to make such\na statement, I would probably arrange for a vehicle to travel at ONE\nmph!  At that speed, the aerodynamic Drag is extremely low, and even\nthe Tire Drag is lower, especially if I filled them with 90 pounds\nof air pressure!  Extremely little electricity would get used\nup in going that mile in that hour!  Say a (private) Test Track was\nset up to allow this vehicle to constantly circle a track.  In a MONTH\nthat vehicle would have traveled around 720 miles, and the batteries\nSTILL probably would not actually yet need to be re-charged.  Such\na test, with some Stamp of Approval from some Independent Observer, would be\nable to actually claim that the vehicle had gone 720 miles and more before\nneeding to be re-charged.  The manufacturer would then feel free to\nbrag about a 720-mile range.</p><p>\n\nIt would technically not be a lie, but no one would ever ride in a\nvehicle that only traveled at 1/3 walking speed!  But it certainly\ncould be done as just described, and that manufacturer would certainly\npromote the daylights out of such a statement, knowing that it would sell\nmassive numbers of their vehicles.  Of course, once people actually\nBOUGHT the vehicles and they all found that it could not even go\nan hour, 60 miles, at highway speed, people would know they had been\ndeceived.  But exactly what could they do about it?  The manufacturer\nwould have an Attested confirmation that their vehicle had traveled\n720 miles without needing a re-charge.  Would any Judge find them\nguilty of any crime?  I don't see how.  And THEY know that!</p><p>\n\nThe point here is that modern promotional and advertising executives\nfeel that there are NO rules regarding ethics or principles or morals\nregarding getting their advertising commissions!  They are willing to\nsay absolutely anything.  If a manufacturer had also been deceitful\nto have done silly Test Runs as I just described, there is virtually no\nlimit to what they might feel free to claim.</p><p>\n\nRegarding many claims, remembering that this is a technology that\nis still being born, it certainly seems that claims are made that\nactually only apply to ONE PART of the complete system.  I have seen\nstatements where a manufacturer announces 98% efficiency of the electric\nmotor.  That might technically be a true statement, but any real\nSYSTEM requires wires and controls and batteries and chargers and much\nmore, all of which degrade any possible claims regarding (overall)\nefficiency.  I remember seeing, in the 1970s, advertising of a\nvery poorly efficient fireplace which claimed \"98% combustion\nefficiency\".  That statement was actually true, but irrelevant!\nTheir heat transfer efficiency was horrendous, around 20%, so the best\nany owner could ever actually see was just under 20% (the product of the\ntwo efficiencies.)  No one stopped that company from claiming that because\nit was actually true.  But they quickly angered so many buyers that\nword got out about their ethics and they soon disappeared!.</p><p>\n\nWe have a presentation at <a href=\"public/cars00.html\">Electric Cars, Hybrid Cars, the Physics</a>.</p><p>\n\n\n</p><hr>\nEnd of footnote 11\n<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\n\n<a name=\"12\"><font size=\"+2\"><b>Photovoltaic (solar to electric) Devices</b></font></a><br><br>\n\nThere are occasional news reports about some new PV technology that\nallegedly has 30% efficiency.  A Reporter listens to a Company\nSpokesperson say that over 100 watts of sunlight power arrives\nin every square foot (true, at noon, on a perfectly sunny day, if\nthe collecting panel is aimed exactly at the Sun).  The Spokesperson\nthen ASSUMES that the customer will buy the state-of-the-air technology\nwhich IS 30% efficient, and PREDICTS that 32 square feet of such PV panels\n(the size of a sheet of plywood or wall paneling) COULD therefore capture a\nspectacular amount of electricity (110w/sf * 32sf * 30% = 1050 Watts\nof electricity!  And the villagers rejoice at this amazing news!<p>\n\nBut that Spokesperson left out a LOT of important facts!  Such as that\nthe technology mentioned is still astoundingly expensive and hard to\nproduce, currently costing maybe $100,000 per square foot!  Such as that most\nclimates have clouds, and that the Sun is NOT always in the ideal\nlocation, and that the PV panels are NOT always aimed exactly at the Sun!</p><p>\n\nThe Spokesperson did not actually lie, but was DECEPTIVE in many ways!</p><p>\n\nThe REALITY is that PV panels that most people can afford to buy are\nof a technology called Cadmium Sulfide, which happens to have atomic\nproperties where they are around 7% efficient.  That a climate like Chicago\nhas a lot of clouds, and that an annual cloudiness factor is often\ndescribed as around 65% (or sky clearness of around 35%, or sometimes\ndescribed as 34%). That a FIXED POSITION PV panel (facing\nsouth, at some angle upward) has geometric disadvantages when the Sun\nis in the eastern or western sky.</p><p>\n\nSo a REALISTIC EXPECTATION of that 32 square feet of PV panels is more\nlikely to be (110 w/sf * 32 sf * 7% * (100% - 65%) * 0.4 = a truly\nconsistent and reliable supply of only about 35 Watts\nof electricity!</p><p>\n\nThis is EXTREMELY different from what the Spokesperson tried to lead\npotential buyers to believe!  It would be GREAT if we could expect that area\nof PV panels to produce 3400 Watts or 1050 Watts, but the reality is that\nit would likely produce an AVERAGE of only 35 Watts instead.  Granted\nthat there WILL be days which are cloud free and at noon on such a\nday, briefly, as much as 220 Watts of electricity might be produced.  But for\nan installation in that region of normal cloudiness, a 12 hour period of\nsunlight might therefore be expected to produce a total average\nof about 420 Watt-hours per day.  Noting that you now pay maybe 15 cents\nper kiloWatt-hour (including Delivery costs and taxes), this is a benefit of\naround 7 cents of electricity produced for you! A solid $26 of FREE\nelectricity for you!  This is due to you having spent between $3200 and\n$4800 to install the PV panels and the associated electronics and batteries.\nWhat a deal!  In maybe 150 years, you will have gotten enough electricity\nto equal what you paid for the equipment (assuming that nothing needs\nany repairs during that 150 years).</p><p>\n\nThe manufacturers and salespeople and spokespeople for PV devices\nknow that they could never actually admit that, or no one would\never buy the products they are trying to sell!</p><p>\n\nSo the public is permitted and encouraged to have a totally wrong,\nsugar-plum-type view of what magic that PVs can do for them!  Someone is\nallowed to come to assume that a few square feet of PV panels will provide\nthem with a consistent and reliable 1050 Watts all day every day, and so\nthey believe that they will be able to fully operate their entire\nhousehold on such a wonderful supply of electricity.  But then once\nthey spend all the many thousand dollars to buy the equipment and then\nto have it all installed, THEN they discover that they ACTUALLY can\nonly RELIABLY count on an average of around 35 Watts instead.  That is\nNOT even enough to light a single 100 Watt light bulb!</p><p>\n\nYes, after an entire day of collecting sunlight, such a setup CAN\ncollect a total of around 400 Watt-hours of electricity, but then after\nthat electricity is put INTO batteries and then later taken back\nOUT of the batteries, you can count on actually having around 300 Wh\nof USABLE electricity from that entire day.  You could light that\none light bulb for about three hours.  Is THAT worth spending\nmany thousands of dollars for?  IF people know the actual facts,\nit seems unlikely that many people would think so.</p><p>\n\nI realize that it does not seem like it from these comments, but I\nVERY STRONGLY ENCOURAGE EXPERIMENTING in Photovoltaics and other\nalternative energy methods. As long as a customer approaches the\nmatter as an EXPERIMENT and an ADVENTURE, fine.  What I rebel to is\nthe fact that few customers are remotely told the truth, in order\nto encourage them to have those sugar-plum-dreams of all the\namazing benefits they will receive. If based on HONEST facts and HONEST\ninformation, I'm in!  But if everything is based on deception and\ndistortion and misleading customers, NO, NO, NO!</p><p>\n\nThis whole realm is another example where ADVERTISERS promote\nPEAK RATINGS for their products, the absolute maximum that they\nhad ever been able to get their products to produce in a test\nlaboratory, under absolutely perfect conditions,\nwhile USERS later discover that such numbers are\nnearly always useless and irrelevant, as they use such products\nin REAL environments!  Many of the energy-related presentations in\nthis Domain are intended to help the public learn what the actual\nfacts are and the reality is!  Where they might then listen to the\nspectacular claims of advertising, and be in a position to then be\nable to ASK INFORMED QUESTIONS!  \"Yes, yes, I realize that\nthe numbers you just cited are possible with this product, but that\nwas in a laboratory under perfect conditions.

And this\nfigures to either be totally worthless or worth many billions of dollars!<p>\n\nThis is VAGUELY related to the HeatGreen concept!</p><p>\n\nThere are TWO ways that organic material can decompose.  One is if there\nis minimal oxygen around, which turns out to be the usual case inside\nthe stomachs of cows and humans and other mammals, which is called\nANAEROBIC DIGESTION.  It uses a type of bacteria which are called\nANAEROBIC BACTERIA.  Anaerobic digestion is NOT very efficient!  Among\nother things, the chemical composition does not completely occur and\nthere is considerable METHANE GAS which is generated. All the jokes\nabout cows and flatulence in people are due to this.  (Did you know\nthat virtually ALL people are flatulent around TWENTY TIMES every day?)\nAnaerobic bacteria also cannot digest some organic materials, which\nwe call FIBER, which then necessarily pass right through us (and cows).\nThe other method is FAR more efficient, and it is called AEROBIC\nDIGESTION.  It uses a different type of bacteria, which are FAR FASTER\nand more effective in digesting virtually all organic materials.\nMore importantly, those aerobic bacteria can nearly completely digest\nALL foods!  NO methane gas is generated, just carbon dioxide (which\nhas no smell!)  And nearly all the food eaten gets digested, which\nprovides more energy for the cow or person and leaves less waste material\nto dispose of!</p><p>\n\nI designed the HG concept to use AEROBIC bacteria, because they are so\nmuch (1) more efficient; (2) faster; and (3) able to decompose far more\norganic materials; than ANAEROBIC bacteria can do.  The anaerobic are worse\nin all those ways,  The bacteria in your intestine or that of a cow\nare bacteria that can survive and operate in an anaerobic environment.\nAnaerobic bacteria also tend to form METHANE gas (CH<sub>4</sub>)\n(which you call flatulence) and that anaerobic digestion leaves a lot of\nunprocessed material (which you call manure). In tremendous contrast,\naerobic digestion generally results entirely in producing CO<sub>2</sub>\nand H<sub>2</sub>O. This is FAR more efficient digestion, of being able\nto get SEVERAL TIMES AS MUCH ENERGY BENEFIT for the body, if and when\naerobic digestion might be regularly done.</p><p>\n\nIn 2008, I had extended that aerobic/anaerobic thought about potential\nexperiments to create \"super-human athletes\" by either sliding\ntwo \"air hoses\" down the esophagus to the stomach, or doing\nan operation to insert such hoses through the abdomen.</p><p>\n\nHere was my thinking at the time:  If one of those hoses had an air\npump and filter, and the other hose was there to release \"used\ngases\", then the stomach and intestine would have a constant supply\nof FAR MORE oxygen in them than is normally the case.  And then, like\nin the HG, it should then only take a few hours before AEROBIC bacteria\nstart digesting the food contents.</p><p>\n\n</p><ul>\n<li>(1) digestion would probably then be FAR faster.\n</li><li>(2) digestion should then include many things that we cannot now\n   digest, such as \"fibre\" or \"roughage\" or even cut\n   lawn grass (which we humans are incapable of digesting and it goes\n   straight through us!), meaning MORE energy capture from the food eaten.\n</li><li>(3) and digestion should then be so complete that we would NOT need\nto \"pass gas\" twenty times every day (the experimental average\nof humans getting rid of the methane that we create).  It seems likely\nthat the amount of manure might also greatly decrease, for having had\nfar more of the materials having been fully digested.\n</li></ul><p>\n\nAt the time, I was only thinking in terms of \"pro athletes\"\nbut I never liked the idea as being somewhat like the illegal drugs\nthat many star athletes use to get an unfair advantage.</p><p>\n\nSo what is the NEW insight?  Say that an Animal Husbandry Researcher\nwould install the pair of air tubes and a small air compressor INTO A COW?</p><p>\n\nThe result SHOULD be that the cow's metabolism should greatly\nincrease, maybe double or triple normal.</p><p>\n\nA MILK COW might then PRODUCE double or triple the milk per day!\nAnd beef cattle might grow two to three times faster, WITHOUT having\nto add all the nasty chemicals in their feed!</p><p>\n\nThis then MIGHT enormously increase the US milk and beef supplies,\npossibly without the cows consuming any additional feed!  It would\nbe ENTIRELY due to their having become far more EFFICIENT at digesting\nfood, by aerobic rather than the current normal anaerobic processes!</p><p>\n\nThere are many unknown variables!  For one thing, cows happen to\nhave a multiple chamber stomach, which enables them to already\ndigest grass and roughage and fiber.  Would there be any effect, good\nor bad, to be pumping in extra air into those stomachs?</p><p>\n\nI admit that I have doubts!  It might not work at all, or it might\nhave detrimental side effects.  Specifically, the stomach might start\nto operate at far higher temperatures than has always naturally\nbeen the case. The bacteria that now digest our food for us and for\ncows operate at around 99°F temperature. I am speculating about\na far higher performance bacteria taking over.  Many are known to\nthrive best when the temperature is over 125°F. Would that\nkill the cow? I do not know and only an experiment could find that out.\nBut for a Research Program to invest a few hundred dollars in ONE COW,\nand then letting it re-join its cow-friends out in a meadow\nto watch IF it ate more or less or different stuff, and to constantly\nmonitor body temperature and respiration rates,\nit seems like a worthwhile expense.</p><p>\n\nYou might be amused at WHY this dawned on me now!  I have always\nbeen amazed since I first discovered the research on humans, about ten years\nago, that we all \"pass gas\" around 20 times every single day.\nAnd there are all the jokes about cows and methane gas.  It dawned\non me that IF I \"converted\" cows from anaerobic to aerobic,\nthen they should no longer be producing methane gas.  Or nearly as\nmany cow patties!  I was thinking about whether THAT might be a\nworthwhile goal, when I realized the \"increased milk production\"\nand \"increased beef production\" consequences which should\nalso occur!</p><p>\n\n\n\n\n</p><hr>\nEnd of footnote 14\n<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\n\n<a name=\"15\"><font size=\"+2\"><b>Is the Universe mostly Dark Matter?</b></font></a><br><br>\n\nThere has never been any actual evidence of this idea.  When the BASIS\nof this concept is examined, it was ENTIRELY due to scientists\nnot having any valid explanation for the way our Milky Way\nGalaxy rotates.  Hundreds of years ago, a scientist named Kepler\nhad discovered some formulas that describe the gravitational\nbehavior of the planets in our Solar System.  Later, Isaac Newton\nproved that Kepler's formulas were actually only approximate, and that\nthey were pretty accurate in the Solar System BECAUSE nearly all the\nmass in the Solar System is inside the Sun at its very center.<p>\n\nAnd yet, the Physics community chose to try to apply Kepler's\nLaws to the Galaxy, where the mass is known to be broadly distributed\nover its entire size!  And then when the Galaxy did not rotate\nas they insisted it should (per Kepler), they started dreaming up\ndozens and dozens of really silly ideas that each claimed would\nfully explain everything!</p><p>\n\nSome have claimed that spiral galaxies are NOT spiral at all,\nbut only APPEAR to be spiral due to effects of (speculated, unseen\nand unproven) gravity waves passing through the galaxy to cause\ngravitational shock waves, which allegedly cause localized\nstar burst patterns where new stars get formed.  They seem to overlook\nthe fact that NO shock wave from ANY direction could cause SPIRAL\nPATTERNS of star bursts!  IF there were such a phenomenon, it would\ncertainly be seen as PLANAR sheets of bright new stars, which would\ngradually pass through that region!</p><p>\n\nBut most other Physicists seem to insist that the Galaxy rotation that\nthey cannot explain is due to massive clumps of invisible material\nin the Galaxy.  IF such an explanation were valid, the DISTRIBUTION of\nwhere that invisible mass would have to be would be truly bizarre!\nAND VERY UNSTABLE!  But more than that, IF there were such invisible\nmasses in the Galaxy, they would also attract OTHER parts of the Galaxy\nwhich the proponents ignore!  Such concepts are so amazingly silly\nthat it is hard to believe that ANY actual Physicist would even\nconsider it worth thought!  But THIS is what NEARLY ALL modern\nAstrophysicists now believe!  At different times, they have called the\ninvisible material Missing Mass, Neutrinos, Exotic Matter, Dark Matter, and\nother things. But NONE of them can be arranged in any actual pattern where\nthey would have the gravitational effects that are claimed for them, and NONE\nof them would be remotely stable even if they could momentarily exist.</p><p>\n\nI feel that a far more simple and traditional explanation explains these\nmatters far better.

It is hard to see how\nand why they became such a cornerstone of modern Astrophysics!<p>\n\nAround 1912, Albert Einstein derived some very complicated equations\nas part of his General Relativity Theory.  Around 1916, another\nPhysicist named Schwarzschild derived a solution to part of them.\nIn his result, his equations acted strangely where in some\nvery specific locations, the math denominator dropped to zero!\nThis meant that the number itself would become infinity.\n<b>This became known as a singularity.</b>  Neither Einstein nor Schwarzschild\nhad any idea of what such a mathematical singularity might actually\nmean in the real universe.  But around 1960, some Physicists chose\nto entirely ignore the real nature of actual material (atoms) and instead\nconsider everything to be describable by mathematics.  This assumption\npermitted them to make a rather strange assumption!  The first part of it\nwas reasonably credible, where a white dwarf star developed such extreme\nhigh density that the atoms of the star (separate protons in the nuclei and\nelectrons revolving around them) being gravitationally jammed together\ninto everything become neutrons (because neutrons are known to be\nsimply the coupling of positively charged protons and negatively charged\nelectrons, and some extra Binding Energy.  THIS then was a hypothesis\nthat there must be NEUTRON STARS, of even smaller diameters, objects\nwhich have the mass of an entire star but all of which is packed into\na space that may only be a few miles in diameter.</p><p>\n\nSince Neutron stars are not charged electrically, they would not\naffect any objects passing near them, except by gravitation.  And they\nare (probably) not hot enough to give off any radiation, so detecting\nNeutron Stars has been an extremely hard task.  The only real\npossibilities found have been in binary star systems, where the\nlarger star that IS giving off light is seen to be apparently orbiting\nwith an unseen companion object of great mass.</p><p>\n\nWell, the part that seems outrageous to me is that someone ASSUMED\nthat if gravitation can be so strong as to force an electron INSIDE\nthe nucleus of an atom to create a neutron, then even greater gravitation\n(due to even higher density) would cause TWO neutrons to get embedded\nwithin each other.  This would then create a new object that was the\nsize of a neutron, but with TWICE the mass of a normal neutron.</p><p>\n\nWell, IF that assumption is accepted as credible, then it is easy to\nsee that the new double-neutron would have TWICE the gravitational\nattraction to a neighbor neutron, and therefore it would certainly\nsuck that one into the object.  We would then have an object which still\nhad the size of a normal neutron, but now with THREE TIMES the mass!\nAnd this would obviously mean that it would even more quickly suck\nin a fourth neutron, then a fifth, and so on.</p><p>\n\nThis rather weak line of reasoning continues on <i>ad infinitatum</i>.\nThere would allegedly never be any limit, and this object would forever\nkeep absorbing more neutrons (and other objects) into that still tiny\nspace of the size of one neutron.  For a few years in the 1960s,\nPhysicists would say that this object would be the size of a neutron\nbut with the mass of our Sun or a thousand or a million Suns.\nEventually, that sort of statement stopped being said.  I think it\nwas due to the speakers realizing how ridiculous it sounds!</p><p>\n\nIn any case, THAT is still the case, the entire reasoning of what\na Black Hole would be.  But it really could only have gotten to be\nthat popular a concept by two conditions:  (1) that no Physicist seems\nto have ever carefully examined the physical reality of what is described\nabove; and (2) that no Physicist seems to have examined that the ENTIRE\nbasis for this very speculative concept was the SINGLE solution by\nSchwarzschild of Einstein's General Relativity equations around 90 years\nago!

This is an\nunavoidable statement.  However, the Earth observers feel that THEY\nare motionless and that he is rapidly moving away from them.  So THEY TOO\nsee this Time Dilation effect, where they see HIM appear to be aging\nmore slowly than they are aging!  <b>Both viewers see the other as\naging more slowly than he ages!</b>  I realize this sounds impossible,\nbut the very basis of Relativity insists on that fact.

Accepted that\nsuch created Radiation might be unfamiliar to us, but it still has\nto exist AT SOME FREQUENCY and WAVELENGTH.  Meaning that it CANNOT be\n\"dark\".\nIn order to accept this idea, it is necessary to entirely abandon\nall trust in many long trusted Laws of science, such as the\nConservation of Energy, Conservation of Momentum, Conservation of\nMass, Relativity, and many others.</p><p> \n\nAmong the rampant application of unsupportable assumptions, a\nrecent addition is a claim that gravity is no longer really important\nand that some ASSUMED new idea is the overwhelming presence in the\nUniverse. Recent claims are that the vast majority of the entire\nUniverse is made of things that we have never been away of and can\nnever be aware of!  There are Physicists who are now announcing that\n75% of the entire Universe is made of Dark Energy and another 20%\nis made of Dark Matter, claiming that the entire Universe we have\nany way of knowing about is only 5% of all existence!  This bizarre idea\narose based on some observations of some objects\nin the Universe which appear to be immensely far away from us.</p><p>\n\nIt is not possible for us to see anything more than a \"snapshot\"\nof extremely distant objects in space, a single momentary view.  We\nare unable to see any variations in brightness level or any other\ncharacteristics that might be useful in determining the size or\nbrightness of really distant objects.  Even the DISTANCE of such\nobjects is a quantity which requires several ASSUMPTIONS.</p><p>\n\nBut apparently in the competition in modern Physics to make the\nmost outrageous statements, the tiniest bit of POTENTIAL evidence\nhas had many layers of assumptions loaded onto it, to result in a\nclaim that all known laws of science are to be discarded!  The claim\nis that those extremely distant objects are moving away from us at\nspeeds which are greater for objects which are farther away from us.\nNow, if that was a VALID statement, it would be amazing.  But that\nstatement was only dreamed up after about a half dozen ASSUMPTIONS\nwere applied to observed data.  Since modern Physics seems to no longer\nrequire any PROOF of any statements made, everyone seems to feel\nfree to dream up any assumptions they wish, to then announce\nstatements as though they are actual science!  No they aren't!  They\nare results of speculative imaginations of people who want to find\nnew assumptions to apply!</p><p>\n\nThe claim referred to here is totally dependent on us knowing the\naccurate distance from us to each extremely distant object.  But such\ndistances cannot be measured!  They have to be ESTIMATED due to the\napplication of several assumptions.  We have NO good way of determining\nreliably accurate distance information for such objects which appear to\nbe at extreme distances from us.  Much of that is based on spectral\nlines being shifted to the red (called the Red Shift) which we ASSUME\nonly occurs due to the speed the object is moving away from us.\nThere is actually no good reason that has to be true!  There might be\nTWENTY different physical processes which exist which cause Red Shifts,\nbut which we are still totally oblivious about!</p><p>\n\nInterestingly, the main basis for the distance we think distant\nobjects are from us is ALSO based on the spectral Red Shift.  When both the\nnumerator and denominator of a fraction are based on the same number,\nthe value of the fraction becomes irrelevant, and that is essentially\nthe situation here.  Another huge assumption which has been universally\nmade is the idea that ALL objects in the Universe which LOOK to be of the\nsame type, are actually absolutely IDENTICAL!  Schoolchildren are\nnever allowed to make such poor assumptions, but modern Physicists feel\nfree to do so!  Based on these assumptions and on several more, it has\nnow been decided that if two ABSOLUTELY IDENTICAL OBJECTS are seen, but\nthey appear to be of different brightness, then one is farther away from\nus as calculated by that difference of brightness.  Unbelievable!</p><p>\n\nIn any case, these assorted assumptions have resulted in the recent\noutrageous announcement that the Universe is in runaway expansion,\nessentially dismissing all the known laws of science.  As a result,\nthe Physicists then decided they could \"explain\" this new (alleged)\nfinding, by speculating an even more outrageous idea, that there\nis an unseen and undetected thing they call Dark Energy.  Allegedly,\nthis latest speculation is supposed to be the opposite of energy and\ngravitation, where it allegedly then would explain a runaway expansion\nof the Universe!  It is sad that no one paused to try to confirm or\ndeny whether the alleged \"evidence\" of a runaway expansion is even\ncredible or valid, before they jumped to make even more outrageous\nannouncements!</p><p>\n\nI tend to wonder if modern Physicists think their future Grants of\nmoney for research will be based on how outrageous their statements\nare!

The basis\nfor this claim is amazingly \"thin\"! One of the equations that\nAlbert Einstein derived in trying to understand General Relativity\nwas especially hard to solve.  It remained unsolved until a\nmathematician/Physicist named Schwarzschild found a solution for that\nequation in 1916.  His solution was troublesome in that there were certain\n(rare) situations where the denominator became exactly zero, which\nmeant that the value of his solution would have to become infinite.\nSince both Einstein and Schwarzschild are universally considered to\nbe absolutely infallible, no one doubted Schwarzschild's solution or\nhis consequence of having a result which could apparently violate ALL\nof known science!  But it took into the 1960s before one of those scientists\nwho seem to have loved to speculate came up with the idea of that\n\"mathematical singularity\" of Schwarzschild being actual reality,\nand the term Black Hole was dreamed up.  (Neither Einstein nor\nSchwarzschild ever claimed existence of any physical singularities.)</p><p>\n\nThere WERE certainly very compact stars known by the 1960s,\nincluding White Dwarfs and Brown Dwarfs.  In a nearly hilarious\nspeculation, one of that group of speculative thinkers decided that\nSchwarzchild's mathematical singularity permitted them to claim that\nit was possible for a proton to (somehow) jam itself into\nthe space used by a different proton!  Their claim was that gravitation\ninside a really compact white dwarf caused this to happen.</p><p>\n\nThey neglected a really obvious FACT!  BOTH the attractive force of a\ngravitational field AND the repulsive force of electrostatic repulsion\nbetween positively-charged protons act according to the inverse square\ndependence.  In other words, if two protons got twice as close,\nyes, the gravitational attraction would increase by a factor of\nfour, but what they overlooked was that the electrostatic repulsion ALSO\nincreased by a factor of four.  <b>Becoming very close would\nNOT cause super-strong attraction, which might (allegedly) become\nso strong that two protons might exist in the space of one!</b></p><p>\n\nHowever, IF they had been correct, then their following logic would\nhave worked!  The new super-proton would gravitationally\nattract other protons TWICE as strongly as the gravitation that\nwould have3 jammed the first two protons together!

This arose based on some observations of some objects\nin the Universe which appear to be immensely far away from us.</p><p>\n\nIt is not possible for us to see anything more than a \"snapshot\"\nof extremely distant objects in space, a single momentary view.  We\nare unable to see any variations in brightness level or any other\ncharacteristics that might be useful in determining the size or\nbrightness of really distant objects.  Even the DISTANCE of such\nobjects is a quantity which requires several ASSUMPTIONS.</p><p>\n\nEdwin Hubble (and others) used Cepheid Variables to try to\nestimate the NEARBY scale of the universe.  They then ASSUMED that ALL\nCepheid Variables which flash at a specific rate MUST have an exact\nspecific mass.  It is still assumed that that assumption is at\nleast moderately true.  Many modern Physicist ASSUME that it is\nEXACTLY true!  In any case, during the 1990s, a new assumption was made.\nIf it is actually correct, then several peculiar new theories might have\nvalidity.  The assumption has to do with a NEED to create a much larger NEW\nmeasurement ruler.  It seems REALLY speculative to me!  There are\nsome very rare events in distant space which are called Type 1-A\nSupernova.  Only a couple of them have EVER been seen in or near\nour Milky Way Galaxy.  But it is ASSUMED that the amount of radiation\ngiven off during the Type 1-A Supernova explosion is a FIXED amount.\nEvidence of possible Type 1-A Supernovae have (rarely) been detected in VERY\ndistant galaxies.  It has been ASSUMED that the DISTANCE of those\ngalaxies MUST BE defined due to the ASSUMED DISTANCE of tbe Type\n1-A Supernova (ASSUMING THAT ALL OF THESE RARE OBJECTS MUST BE\nabsolutely identical.  There seems NO actual evidence which would suggest\nthat this speculative assumption is true!)</p><p>\n\nBut apparently in the competition in modern Physics to make the\nmost outrageous statements, the tiniest bit of POTENTIAL evidence\nhas had many layers of assumptions loaded onto it, to result in a\nclaim that all known laws of science are to be discarded!  The claim\nis that those (allegedly) extremely distant objects are moving away from us\nat speeds which are greater for objects which are farther away from us.\nNow, if that was a VALID statement, it would be amazing.  But that\nstatement was only dreamed up after about a half dozen ASSUMPTIONS\nwere applied to observed data.  Since modern Physics seems to no longer\nrequire any PROOF of any statements made, everyone seems to feel\nfree to dream up any assumptions they wish, to then announce\nstatements as though they are actual science!  No they aren't!  They\nare results of speculative imaginations of people who want to find\nnew assumptions to apply!</p><p>\n\nThe claim referred to here is totally dependent on us knowing the\naccurate distance from us to each extremely distant object.  <b>But such\ndistances cannot be measured!</b>  They have to be ESTIMATED due to the\napplication of several assumptions.  We have NO good way of determining\nreliably accurate distance information for such objects which appear to\nbe at extreme distances from us.  Much of that is based on spectral\nlines being shifted to the red (called the Red Shift) which we ASSUME\nonly occurs due to the speed the object is moving away from us.\nThere is actually no good reason that has to be true!  There might be\nTWENTY different physical processes which exist which cause Red Shifts,\nbut which we are still totally oblivious about!</p><p>\n\nInterestingly, the main basis for the distance we think distant\nobjects are from us is ALSO based on the spectral Red Shift.  When both the\nnumerator and denominator of a fraction are based on the same number,\nthe value of the fraction becomes irrelevant, and that is essentially\nthe situation here.  Another huge assumption which has been universally\nmade is the idea that ALL objects in the Universe which LOOK to be of the\nsame type, are actually absolutely IDENTICAL!  Specifically, Type 1-A\nSupernova.  Schoolchildren are\nnever allowed to make such poor assumptions, but modern Physicists feel\nfree to do so!  Based on these assumptions and on several more, it has\nnow been decided that if two APPARENTLY IDENTICAL OBJECTS are seen, but\nthey appear to be of different brightness, then one is farther away from\nus as calculated by that difference of brightness.  Unbelievable!</p><p>\n\nIn any case, these assorted assumptions have resulted in the recent\noutrageous announcement that the Universe is in runaway expansion,\nessentially dismissing all the known laws of science.  As a result,\nthe Physicists then decided they could \"explain\" this new (alleged)\nfinding, by speculating an even more outrageous idea, that there\nis an unseen and undetected thing they call Dark Energy.  Allegedly,\nthis latest speculation is supposed to be the opposite of energy and\ngravitation, where it allegedly then would explain a runaway expansion\nof the Universe!  It is sad that no one paused to try to confirm or\ndeny whether the alleged \"evidence\" of a runaway expansion is even\ncredible or valid, before they jumped to make even more outrageous\nannouncements!</p><p>\n\nI tend to wonder if modern Physicists think their future Grants of\nmoney for research will be based on how outrageous their statements\nare!  Science and Physics seems to have gotten lost along the way.</p><p>\n\n\n\nEnd of footnote 58\n<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\n\n<a name=\"59\"><font size=\"+2\"><b>Universe is Chock Full of Neutrinos</b></font></a><br><br>\n\nThis is another idea in Physics which was speculated to be true,\neven though it totally violated many well-established scientific Laws!\nThe way the idea arose is humorously curious!

It was ASSUMED that the nuclei also\ncontained specific numbers of neutrons, in order to account for the\nneeded extra mass.  Physics has accepted that assumption ever since\nthen.  Careful examination of modern precise values of atomic\nmasses seems to have now proven that assumption to have been\nincorrect.  Instead of neutrons existing inside atomic nuclei,\nthere appear instead to be SEPARATE protons and electrons inside the\nnuclei.  This difference seems to have extremely little change in\nthe characteristics of atomic nuclei, but it eliminates many\nsmall errors in exact values of atomic mass.</p><p>\n\nIt also eliminates the need for massive numbers of neutrinos to\nneed to be created and absorbed by nuclear processes, and it seems\nto also eliminate the need for a peculiar idea.  During the 1930s,\nit was realized that mutual electrostatic repulsion of the closely-packed\nprotons inside each nucleus by Coulomb's Law of electrostatics, would\nseem to immediately cause nearly all atomic nuclei to fly apart and\ncease to exist.  Since it was known that most atomic nuclei are\nextremely stable, the Physicists of the 1930s ASSUMED that there\nwas an \"extra force which existed\", which became called the Strong\nNuclear Force.  The Strong was ASSUMED to be tremendously powerful\nat small distances, in order to overcome the mutual repulsive forces\nbetween the protons, to keep atomic nuclei from flying apart.  The\nStrong was ASSUMED to have a distance dependence of either an\ninverse-third-power or inverse-fifth-power effect, in order for it to\nhave the needed tremendous strength at tiny distances while not having any\ndetectable effects at greater (atomic) distances.  But NO experiment has\never detected any actual evidence of any Strong Nuclear Force.  There\nare only IMPLIED bits of evidence, all of which require various\nassumptions of their own.</p><p>\n\nIn the late 1990s, I began to statistically examine the highly\nrespected NIST data regarding precise experimentally measured masses\nof atomic nuclei, with the single intention of trying to determine\nwhether the Strong was actually an inverse-third-power or inverse-fifth-power\neffect.  I had been troubled by noting that NO ONE ever seemed to try\nto actually specify which was true, regarding such a basic characteristic\nof such an important nuclear force!</p><p>\n\nLike in many other scientific investigations, my statistical analysis\nof the data surprised me in apparently showing that NEITHER was true,\nand that, IF protons and electrons were moving around separately\nwithin each atomic nucleus, the presence of the negatively charged\nelectrons provides ATTRACTIVE electrostatic effects on the protons\nto keep them from flying out of the nucleus.  So the ASSUMED Strong\nNuclear Force appears to not even be necessary, or desirable, in\nmaintaining the stability of most atomic nuclei.  In fact, simple\ngeometric arrangements of the protons and electrons within atomic\nnuclei seem to provide wonderfully obvious explanations for many\nnuclear behaviors, without having to assume any Strong Nuclear Force,\nor the existence of Pions within nuclei, or neutrinos.</p><p>\n\nMy statistical analysis of the NIST data has now convinced me that\nthere probably is NOT any Strong Nuclear Force, and likely no pions\nor neutrinos INSIDE atomic nuclei.  Yes, pions and neutrinos exist\nOUTSIDE of atomic nuclei, but much of the basic reasoning of\nNuclear Physics seems now to be entirely different than previously\nASSUMED.</p><p>\n\nSee <a href=\"public2/nuclei6.html\">Nuclear Physics - Statistical Analysis of Isotope Masses</a>.

Unfortunately,\nthe mathematicians/physicists who try to solve such equations tend\nto make their own ASSUMPTIONS in order to get solutions.  This situation\nhas resulted in Physicists feeling free to make totally outrageous\nassumptions, and then solving some equations, and no one questions the\nvalidity of their claims!  This has resulted in modern Physics having\ncome to be centered on an assortment of silly ideas.  The ideas are\nsafe from ever being disproven because they claim to describe objects\nand processes which are so incredibly tiny that no (future) experiment\ncould ever detect any of them!  So String Theory, Super-Strings, Branes,\nand an endless assortment of speculations have been dreamed up by\nvarious Physicists in recent decades.  Since no possible experiment\ncould ever detect such tiny objects or processes, they are each free\nto give as many lectures as they wish, with no possible challenge\nto their claims.</p><p>\n\nBut all those speculative ideas were created as consequences of\nassumptions that were speculative on their own, and much of these\nareas of modern Physics are totally based on other earlier assumptions\nwhich ARE definitely wrong!

And they get away with it because there is no one other\nthan Physicists who can have any clue what they are trying to talk\nabout!  So when some Physicist announces that there are 10 spatial\ndimensions rather than the three we know about, no one questions such\na statement!  When another announces that there are 26 spatial dimensions,\nagain, there is no challenge!  This silliness is due to so many layers\nof wild and speculative assumptions being stacked on other unsupported\nassumptions that reality has lost the field!
