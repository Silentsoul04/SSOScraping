The company - based in Hamburg - was founded in December 2011 and invests early stage capital and later stage capital in innovative game developers (Browser, Mobile), providers of technology and affiliate programs. Now, the investors are going to introduce themselves to the international audience. They will be present at the Games Connect and at the Game Developer Conference (GDC, Expo Hall, booth number 2232) from March 5th till March 9th in San Francisco.</h2><p>The founders of iVentureCapital are four experienced internet entrepreneurs, who are successfully doing business together in the technology sector for 15 years. At present, their different companies have about 200 employees. One part, for example, is the payment expert BillingPartner, which is established in the games industry. Michael Reul, iVentureCapital’s Co-Founder and Senior Partner about the new foundation: \"We combine our investments with our wealth of experience in fields like billing, traffic generation and distribution, SEO, SEM, marketing and monetization of digital content. Unlike classic VC companies, we are an active entrepreneur offering a variety of options to support startups.\" iVentureCapital considers itself a mid- to long-term investor. Therefore, both exits and dividend-orientated investments are interesting options. iVentureCaptial focuses on startups doing business for at least 12 months. They should be able to present first achievements. Developers of browser- or moblie-games are just as interesting as providers of technology for the mobile field or affiliate- and ad-programs. iVentureCapital will be glad to provide further information and to arrange a meeting with you at the GDC.

The portfolio companies will exchange information about their plans for integrating Advent and the Holidays into their game concepts. Particularly the game developers among our portfolio consider extensive Christmas promotions an important part of their year’s planning. At the iPoTs Workshop, they will present their plans and work out ways to improve their concept in cooperation with the other portfolio members. Another topic for the workshop is community management. The iPoTs will be able to take a closer look at their experience and plans regarding development, management and maintenance of communities and to take home new ideas and suggestions. As usual, the iPoTs Meeting in Hamburg will end with an enjoyable dinner.
