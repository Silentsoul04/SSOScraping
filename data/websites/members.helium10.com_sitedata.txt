Some of the testimonialists on this site receive affiliate commissions based on sales of products or services for which they give testimonials.

For Testimonials we post on our site that are in the nature of \"success story\" or \"best-case\" scenario testimonials (as distinguished from subjective opinions), we have data that will substantiate the results and also provide statements of expected typical results we believe consumers will generally achieve with our product or service, and we will provide this information upon request - email compliance.officer-at-helium10.com.  If you do not request substantiation data from us, you should assume that the results achieved by these testimonialists are the exception and not the rule, and for this reason, you should not expect to achieve the same level of results, or any positive results at all.<br><br>3.\t&nbsp;Subjective Opinion Testimonials We Post.   For Testimonials we post on our site that are in the nature of subjective opinions, we do not independently verify, nor do we seek independent verification; however, to the best of our knowledge we believe the testimonialists are giving their honest opinions.
